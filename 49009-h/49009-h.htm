<p class="drop-cap">When I first resolved upon doing myself this honour,
I could not but indulge a certain vanity in dating
from this little covert, where I have frequently had the
honour of your Lordship's company, and received from
you very many obligations. The elegant solitude of
this place, and the greatest pleasures of it, I owe to
its being so near those beautiful manors wherein you
sometimes reside: it is not retiring from the world,
but enjoying its most valuable blessings, when a man
is permitted to share in your Lordship's conversations
in the country. All the bright images which the wits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of past ages have left behind them in their writings,
the noble plans which the greatest statesmen have laid
down for administration of affairs, are equally the
familiar objects of your knowledge. But what is
peculiar to your Lordship above all the illustrious
personages that have appeared in any age, is, that wit
and learning have from your example fallen into a
new era. Your patronage has produced those arts,
which before shunned the commerce of the world, into
the service of life; and it is to you we owe, that the
man of wit has turned himself to be a man of business.
The false delicacy of men of genius, and the objections
which others were apt to insinuate against their abilities
for entering into affairs, have equally vanished. And
experience has shown, that men of letters are not only
qualified with a greater capacity, but also a greater
integrity in the despatch of business. Your own studies
have been diverted from being the highest ornament,
to the highest use to mankind, and the capacities which
would have rendered you the greatest poet of your age,
have to the advantage of Great Britain been employed
in pursuits which have made you the most able and
unbiassed patriot. A vigorous imagination, an extensive
apprehension, and a ready judgment have distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>you in all the illustrious parts of administration, in a
reign attended with such difficulties, that the same
talents without the same quickness in the possession of
them would have been incapable of conquering. The
natural success of such abilities has advanced you to a
seat in that illustrious House where you were received
by a crowd of your relations. Great as you are in your
honours and personal qualities, I know you will forgive
a humble neighbour the vanity of pretending to a place
in your friendship, and subscribing himself,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">My Lord,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 13em;">and most devoted Servant,</span><br />

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Charles Montague, grandson of the first Earl of Manchester, was
born in 1661, at Horton, in Northamptonshire, and was educated at
Westminster, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1687 he
joined with Prior in writing the "County and the City Mouse,"
a burlesque on Dryden's "Hind and Panther." Montague was
amongst those who signed the invitation sent to William of Orange.
After the Revolution, he was made a Lord of the Treasury (March
1692), Chancellor of the Exchequer (1694), and First Lord of the
Treasury in 1698. These last two offices he held together until
1699. Among the important schemes which he carried out were a
re-coining of the money, the founding of the Bank of England and
the new East India Company, and the issue of Exchequer bills. In
1700 he was made Auditor of the Exchequer, and was created Baron
Halifax. A Tory House of Commons twice attacked him, but
without success. In 1706 he took a leading part in the negotiations
which led to the Union with Scotland. He voted for the sentence
upon Dr. Sacheverell in 1710, and in the subsequent peace negotiations
he opposed the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht. In October 1714 he
again became First Lord of the Treasury, and was created Viscount
Sunbury and Earl of Halifax; but he died in May 1715. He was
the patron of numerous men of letters, and was lauded by many as a
second M&aelig;cenas. Pope says he was "fed with soft dedication all
day long." In 1711 Steele and Addison dedicated the second volume
of the <cite>Spectator</cite> to Lord Halifax.</p>

From <em>Tuesday, July 4</em>, to <em>Thursday, July 6, 1710</em>.</h2>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, July 5.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I was this morning reading the tenth canto in the
fourth book of Spenser, in which Sir Scudamore relates
the progress of his courtship to Amoret under a
very beautiful allegory, which is one of the most natural
and unmixed of any in that most excellent author. I
shall transprose it, to use Mr. Bayes's term,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> for the benefit
of many English lovers who have by frequent letters desired
me to lay down some rules for the conduct of their
virtuous amours; and shall only premise, that by the
shield of love is meant a generous, constant passion for
the person beloved.</p>

<p>When the fame, says he, of this celebrated beauty first
flew abroad, I went in pursuit of her to the Temple
of Love. This temple, continues he, bore the name
of the goddess Venus, and was seated in a most fruitful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>island, walled by nature against all invaders. There was
a single bridge that led into the island, and before it a
castle garrisoned by twenty knights. Near the castle was
an open plain, and in the midst of it a pillar, on which
was hung the shield of love; and underneath it, in letters
of gold, was this inscription:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Happy the man who well can use his bliss;</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Whose ever be the shield, fair Amoret be his.</em><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>My heart panted upon reading the inscription: I struck
upon the shield with my spear. Immediately issued forth
a knight well mounted, and completely armed, who,
without speaking, ran fiercely at me. I received him as
well as I could, and by good fortune threw him out of
the saddle. I encountered the whole twenty successively,
and leaving them all extended on the plain, carried off
the shield in token of victory. Having thus vanquished
my rivals, I passed on without impediment, till I came to
the outermost gate of the bridge, which I found locked
and barred. I knocked and called, but could get no
answer. At last I saw one on the other side of the gate,
who stood peeping through a small crevice. This was
the porter; he had a double face resembling a Janus, and
was continually looking about him, as if he mistrusted
some sudden danger. His name, as I afterwards learned,
was Doubt. Over against him sat Delay, who entertained
passengers with some idle story, while they lost such
opportunities as were never to be recovered. As soon as
the porter saw my shield, he opened the gate; but upon
my entering, Delay caught hold of me, and would fain
have made me listen to her fooleries. However, I shook
her off, and passed forward till I came to the second gate,
the Gate of Good Desert, which always stood wide open;
but in the porch was a hideous giant, that stopped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
entrance: his name was Danger. Many warriors of good
reputation, not able to bear the sternness of his look,
went back again. Cowards fled at the first sight of him,
except some few, who watching their opportunity, slipped
by him unobserved. I prepared to assault him; but upon
the first sight of my shield, he immediately gave way.
Looking back upon him, I found his hinder parts much
more deformed and terrible than his face; Hatred, Murder,
Treason, Envy, and Detraction lying in ambush behind
him, to fall upon the heedless and unwary.</p>

<p>I now entered the Island of Love, which appeared in
all the beauties of art and nature, and feasted every sense
with the most agreeable objects. Amidst a pleasing
variety of walks and alleys, shady seats and flowery
banks, sunny hills and gloomy valleys, were thousands
of lovers sitting, or walking together in pairs, and
singing hymns to the deity of the place.</p>

<p>I could not forbear envying this happy people, who
were already in possession of all they could desire.
While I went forward to the temple, the structure was
beautiful beyond imagination. The gate stood open.
In the entrance sat a most amiable woman, whose name
was Concord.</p>

<p>On either side of her stood two young men, both
strongly armed, as if afraid of each other. As I afterwards
learned, they were both her sons, but begotten
of her by two different fathers; their names, Love and
Hatred.</p>

<p>The lady so well tempered and reconciled them both,
that she forced them to join hands; though I could not
but observe, that Hatred turned aside his face, as not
able to endure the sight of his younger brother.</p>

<p>I at length entered the inmost temple, the roof of
which was raised upon a hundred marble pillars, decked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
with crowns, chains, and garlands. The ground was
strewn with flowers. A hundred altars, at each of
which stood a virgin priestess clothed in white, blazed
all at once with the sacrifice of lovers, who were perpetually
sending up their vows to heaven in clouds of
incense.</p>

<p>In the midst stood the goddess herself, upon an
altar, whose substance was neither gold nor stone, but
infinitely more precious than either. About her neck
flew numberless flocks of little Loves, Joys, and Graces;
and all about her altar lay scattered heaps of lovers,
complaining of the disdain, pride, or treachery of their
mistresses. One among the rest, no longer able to
contain his grief, broke out into the following prayer:
"Venus, queen of grace and beauty, joy of gods and
men, who with a smile becalmest the seas, and renewest
all nature; goddess, whom all the different species in
the universe obey with joy and pleasure, grant I may at
last obtain the object of my vows."</p>

<p>The impatient lover pronounced this with great vehemence;
but I in a soft murmur besought the goddess
to lend me her assistance. While I was thus praying,
I chanced to cast my eye on a company of ladies, who
were assembled together in a corner of the temple waiting
for the anthem.</p>

<p>The foremost seemed something elder and of a more
composed countenance than the rest, who all appeared
to be under her direction. Her name was Womanhood.
On one side of her sat Shamefacedness, with blushes
rising in her cheeks, and her eyes fixed upon the ground:
on the other was Cheerfulness, with a smiling look, that
infused a secret pleasure into the hearts of all that saw
her. With these sat Modesty, holding her hand on her
heart; Courtesy, with a graceful aspect, and obliging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
behaviour; and the two sisters, who were always
linked together, and resembled each other, Silence and
Obedience.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Thus sat they all around in seemly rate,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>And in the midst of them a goodly maid</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Even in the lap of Womanhood there sat,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>The which was all in lily-white arrayed,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Where silver streams among the linen strayed;</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Like to the morn, when first her shining face</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Hath to the gloomy world itself bewrayed.</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>That same was fairest Amoret in place,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Shining with beauty's light, and heavenly virtue's grace.</em><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As soon as I beheld the charming Amoret, my heart
throbbed with hopes. I stepped to her, and seized her
hand; when Womanhood immediately rising up, sharply
rebuked me for offering in so rude a manner to lay hold
on a virgin. I excused myself as modestly as I could,
and at the same time displayed my shield; upon which,
as soon as she beheld the god emblazoned with his bow
and shafts, she was struck mute, and instantly retired.</p>

<p>I still held fast the fair Amoret, and turning my eyes
towards the goddess of the place, saw that she favoured
my pretensions with a smile, which so emboldened me,
that I carried off my prize.</p>

<p>The maid, sometimes with tears, sometimes with
smiles, entreated me to let her go: but I led her
through the temple-gate, where the goddess Concord,
who had favoured my entrance, befriended my retreat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This allegory is so natural, that it explains itself.
The persons in it are very artfully described, and disposed
in proper places. The posts assigned to Doubt,
Delay, and Danger, are admirable. The Gate of Good
Desert has something noble and instructive in it. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
above all, I am most pleased with the beautiful group
of figures in the corner of the temple. Among these,
Womanhood is drawn like what the philosophers call
a universal nature, and is attended with beautiful
representatives of all those virtues that are the ornaments
of the female sex, considered in its natural perfection
and innocence.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The learned world are very much offended at many
of my ratiocinations, and have but a very mean
opinion of me as a politician. The reason of this is, that
some erroneously conceive a talent for politics to consist
in the regard to a man's own interest; but I am of quite
another mind, and think the first and essential quality
towards being a statesman is to have a public spirit.
One of the gentlemen who are out of humour with me,
imputes my falling into a way wherein I am so very
awkward to a barrenness of invention, and has the
charity to lay new matter before me for the future.
He is at the bottom my friend, but is at a loss to know
whether I am a fool or a physician, and is pleased to
expostulate with me with relation to the latter. He
falls heavy upon licentiates, and seems to point more
particularly at us who are not regularly of the faculty.
But since he has been so civil to me as to meddle only
with those who are employed no further than about
men's lives, and not reflected upon me as of the astro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>logical
sect, who concern ourselves about lives and
fortunes also, I am not so much hurt as to stifle any
part of his fond letter.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

some people, that you begin to be short of matter
for your Lucubrations. Though several of them now and
then did appear somewhat dull and insipid to me, I was
always charitably inclined to believe the fault lay in
myself, and that I wanted the true key to uncipher your
mysteries, and remember your advertisement upon this
account. But since I have seen you fall in an unpardonable
error, yea, with a relapse: I mean, since I have seen
you turn politician in the present unhappy dissensions, I
have begun to stagger, and could not choose but lessen
the great value I had for the censor of our isle. How
is it possible that a man, whom interest did naturally
lead to a constant impartiality in these matters, and who
hath wit enough to judge that his opinion was not like
to make many proselytes; how is it possible, I say, that
a little passion (for I have still too good an opinion of
you to think you was bribed by the staggering party)
could blind you so far as to offend the very better half
of the nation, and to lessen off so much the number of
your friends? Mr. Morphew will not have cause to
thank you, unless you give over, and endeavour to regain
what you have lost. There is still a great many themes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
you have left untouched; such as the ill-managements
of matters relating to law and physic, the setting down
rules for knowing the quacks in both professions. What
a large field is there left in discovering the abuses of the
College, who had a charter and privileges granted them
to hinder the creeping in and prevailing of quacks and
pretenders; and yet grant licences to barbers, and write
letters of recommendation in the country towns, out of
the reach of their practice, in favour of mere boys; valuing
the health and lives of their countrymen no further than
they get money by them. You have said very little or
nothing about the dispensation of justice in town and
country, where clerks are the counsellors to their masters.</p>

<p>"But as I can't expect that the censor of Great
Britain should publish a letter, wherein he is censured
with too much reason himself; yet I hope you will be
the better for it, and think upon the themes I have
mentioned, which must certainly be of greater service
to the world, yourself, and Mr. Morphew, than to let us
know whether you are a Whig or a Tory. I am still</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This gentleman and I differ about the words "staggering"
and "better part"; but instead of answering to
the particulars of this epistle, I shall only acquaint my
correspondent, that I am at present forming my thoughts
upon the foundation of Sir Scudamore's progress in
Spenser,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which has led me from all other amusements,
to consider the state of love in this island; and from
the corruptions in the government of that, to deduce
the chief evils of life. In the meantime that I am thus
employed, I have given positive orders to Don Saltero,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Chelsea, the tooth-drawer, and Dr. Thomas Smith,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the
corn-cutter, of King Street, Westminster (who have the
modesty to confine their pretensions to manual operations),
to bring me in, with all convenient speed, complete
lists of all who are but of equal learning with themselves,
and yet administer physic beyond the feet and gums.
These advices I shall reserve for my future leisure; but
have now taken a resolution to dedicate the remaining
part of this instant July to the service of the fair sex,
and have almost finished a scheme for settling the whole
remainder of that sex who are unmarried, and above the
age of twenty-five.</p>

<p>In order to this good and public service, I shall
consider the passion of love in its full extent, as it is
attended both with joys and inquietudes; and lay down,
for the conduct of my lovers, such rules as shall banish
the cares, and heighten the pleasures, which flow from
that amiable spring of life and happiness. There is no
less than an absolute necessity that some provision be
made to take off the dead stock of women in city, town,
and country. Let there happen but the least disorder
in the streets, and in an instant you see the inequality
of the numbers of males and females. Besides that the
feminine crowd on such occasions is more numerous in
the open way, you may observe them also to the very
garrets huddled together, four at least at a casement.
Add to this, that by an exact calculation of all that have
come to town by stage-coach or waggon for this twelvemonth
last, three times in four the treated persons have
been males. This over-stock of beauty, for which there
are so few bidders, calls for an immediate supply of lovers
and husbands; and I am the studious knight-errant who
have suffered long nocturnal contemplations to find out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
methods for the relief of all British females who at
present seem to be devoted to involuntary virginity.
The scheme upon which I design to act, I have communicated
to none but a beauteous young lady (who has
for some time left the town), in the following letter:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">                     "To <span class="smcap">Amanda</span>, in Kent.
</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I send with this, my discourse of ways and means for
encouraging marriage, and repeopling the island.
You will soon observe, that according to these rules, the
mean considerations (which make beauty and merit cease
to be the objects of love and courtship) will be fully
exploded. I have unanswerably proved, that jointures
and settlements are the bane of happiness; and not only
so, but the ruin even of their fortunes who enter into
them. I beg of you, therefore, to come to town upon
the receipt of this, where I promise you, you shall have
as many lovers as toasters; for there needed nothing but
to make men's interests fall in with their inclinations, to
render you the most courted of your sex. As many as
love you will now be willing to marry you: hasten then,
and be the honourable mistress of mankind. Cassander,
and many others, stand in the Gate of Good Desert<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to
receive you. I am,</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, July 10.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The intended course of my studies was altered this
evening by a visit from an old acquaintance, who
complained to me, mentioning one upon whom he had
long depended, that he found his labour and perseverance
in his patron's service and interests wholly ineffectual;
and he thought now, after his best years were
spent in a professed adherence to him and his fortunes,
he should in the end be forced to break with him, and
give over all further expectations from him. He sighed,
and ended his discourse by saying, "You, Mr. Censor,
some time ago, gave us your thoughts of the behaviour
of great men to their creditors. This sort of demand
upon them, for what they invite men to expect, is a debt
of honour, which, according to custom, they ought to be
most careful of paying, and would be a very worthy subject
for a lucubration."</p>

<p>Of all men living, I think, I am the most proper to
treat of this matter; because in the character and employment
of censor, I have had encouragement so infinitely
above my desert, that what I say cannot possibly
be supposed to arise from peevishness, or any disappointment
in that kind which I myself have met with. When
we consider patrons and their clients, those who receive
addresses, and those who are addressed to, it must not
be understood that the dependants are such as are worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>less
in their natures, abandoned to any vice or dishonour,
or such as without a call thrust themselves upon men in
power; nor when we say patrons, do we mean such as
have it not in their power, or have no obligation, to assist
their friends; but we speak of such leagues where there
are power and obligation on the one part, and merit and
expectation on the other. Were we to be very particular
on this subject, I take it that the division of patron and
client may include a third part of our nation. The want
of merit and real worth will strike out about ninety-nine
in the hundred of these, and want of ability in the patron
will dispose of as many of that order. He who out of
mere vanity to be applied to will take up another's time
and fortune in his service, where he has no prospect of
returning it, is as much more unjust as those who took
up my friend the upholder's<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> goods without paying him
for them. I say, he is as much more unjust as our life
and time is more valuable than our goods and movables.
Among many whom you see about the great, there is a
contented, well-pleased set, who seem to like the attendance
for its own sake, and are early at the abodes of
the powerful, out of mere fashion. This sort of vanity
is as well grounded as if a man should lay aside his
own plain suit, and dress himself up in a gay livery of
another's.</p>

<p>There are many of this species who exclude others
of just expectation, and make those proper dependants
appear impatient, because they are not so cheerful as
those who expect nothing. I have made use of the
penny post for the instruction of these voluntary slaves,
and informed them, that they will never be provided for;
but they double their diligence upon admonition. Will
Afterday has told his friends, that he was to have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
next thing these ten years; and Harry Linger has been
fourteen within a month of a considerable office. However
the fantastic complaisance which is paid to them
may blind the great from seeing themselves in a just light,
they must needs (if they in the least reflect) at some
times have a sense of the injustice they do in raising in
others a false expectation. But this is so common a
practice in all the stages of power, that there are not
more cripples come out of the wars than from the
attendance of patrons. You see in one a settled melancholy,
in another a bridled rage, a third has lost his
memory, and a fourth his whole constitution and humour.
In a word, when you see a particular cast of mind or
body, which looks a little upon the distracted, you may
be sure the poor gentleman has formerly had great
friends. For this reason, I have thought it a prudent
thing to take a nephew of mine out of a lady's service,
where he was a page, and have bound him to a shoemaker.</p>

<p>But what of all the humours under the sun is the most
pleasant to consider, is, that you see some men lay as it
were a set of acquaintance by them, to converse with
when they are out of employment, who had no effect of
their power when they were in. Here patrons and clients
both make the most fantastical figure imaginable. Friendship
indeed is most manifested in adversity; but I do
not know how to behave myself to a man who thinks me
his friend at no other time but that. Dick Reptile of
our club had this in his head the other night, when he
said, "I am afraid of ill news when I am visited by any
of my old friends." These patrons are a little like some
fine gentlemen, who spend all their hours of gaiety with
their wenches, but when they fall sick, will let no one
come near them but their wives. It seems, truth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
honour are companions too sober for prosperity. It is
certainly the most black ingratitude to accept of a man's
best endeavours to be pleasing to you, and return it with
indifference.</p>

<p>I am so much of this mind, that Dick Estcourt<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the
comedian, for coming one night to our club, though he
laughed at us all the time he was there, shall have our
company at his play on Thursday. A man of talents is
to be favoured, or never admitted. Let the ordinary
world truck for money and wares, but men of spirit and
conversation should in every kind do others as much
pleasure as they receive from them. But men are so
taken up with outward forms, that they do not consider
their actions; else how should it be, that a man shall
deny that to the entreaties and almost tears of an old
friend, which he shall solicit a new one to accept of?
I remember, when I first came out of Staffordshire, I had
an intimacy with a man of quality, in whose gift there
fell a very good employment. All the town cried,
"There's a thing for Mr. Bickerstaff!" when, to my
great astonishment, I found my patron had been forced
upon twenty artifices to surprise a man with it who never
thought of it. But sure it is a degree of murder to
amuse men with vain hopes. If a man takes away another's
life, where is the difference, whether he does it by
taking away the minutes of his time, or the drops of his
blood? But indeed, such as have hearts barren of kindness
are served accordingly by those whom they employ,
and pass their lives away with an empty show of civility
for love, and an insipid intercourse of a commerce in
which their affections are no way concerned. But on the
other side, how beautiful is the life of a patron who
performs his duty to his inferiors? a worthy merchant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>who employs a crowd of artificers? a great lord who
is generous and merciful to the several necessities of his
tenants? a courtier who uses his credit and power for
the welfare of his friends? These have in their several
stations a quick relish of the exquisite pleasure of doing
good. In a word, good patrons are like the guardian
angels of Plato, who are ever busy, though unseen, in
the care of their wards; but ill patrons are like the
deities of Epicurus, supine, indolent, and unconcerned,
though they see mortals in storms and tempests even
while they are offering incense to their power.</p>

<h3><em>Grecian Coffee-house, July 12.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">When I came hither this evening, the man of the
house delivered me a book very finely bound.
When I received it, I overheard one of the boys whisper
another, and say, "It was a fine thing to be a great
scholar! What a pretty book that is!" It has indeed
a very gay outside, and is dedicated to me by a very
ingenious gentleman, who does not put his name to it.
The title of it (for the work is in Latin) is, "Epistolarum
Obscurorum Virorum, ad Dm. M. Ortuinum
Gratium, Volumina II. &amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> ("The Epistles of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>Obscure Writers to Ortuinus, &amp;c."). The purpose of
the work is signified in the dedication, in very elegant
language, and fine raillery. It seems this is a collection
of letters which some profound blockheads, who lived
before our times, have written in honour of each other,
and for their mutual information in each other's absurdities.
They are mostly of the German nation, whence
from time to time inundations of writers have flowed,
more pernicious to the learned world than the swarms
of Goths and Vandals to the politic. It is, methinks,
wonderful, that fellows could be awake, and utter such
incoherent conceptions, and converse with great gravity
like learned men, without the least taste of knowledge
or good sense. It would have been an endless labour to
have taken any other method of exposing such impertinences,
than by an edition of their own works, where
you see their follies, according to the ambition of such
<em>virtuosi</em>, in a most correct edition.</p>

<p>Looking over these accomplished labours, I could
not but reflect upon the immense load of writings which
the commonalty of scholars have pushed into the world,
and the absurdity of parents, who educate crowds to
spend their time in pursuit of such cold and sprightless
endeavours to appear in public. It seems therefore a
fruitless labour to attempt the correction of the taste of
our contemporaries, except it was in our power to burn
all the senseless labours of our ancestors. There is a
secret propensity in nature from generation to generation
in the blockheads of one age to admire those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>another; and men of the same imperfections are as
great admirers of each other, as those of the same
abilities.</p>

<p>This great mischief of voluminous follies proceeds
from a misfortune which happens in all ages, that men
of barren geniuses, but fertile imaginations, are bred
scholars. This may at first appear a paradox; but when
we consider the talking creatures we meet in public
places, it will no longer be such. Ralph Shallow is a
young fellow, that has not by nature any the least propensity
to strike into what has not been observed and
said every day of his life by others; but with that inability
of speaking anything that is uncommon, he has
a great readiness at what he can speak of, and his imagination
runs into all the different views of the subject he
treats of in a moment. If Ralph had learning added to
the common chit-chat of the town, he would have been
a disputant upon all topics that ever were considered by
men of his own genius. As for my part, I never am
teased by an empty town-fellow, but I bless my stars
that he was not bred a scholar. This addition, we must
consider, would have made him capable of maintaining
his follies. His being in the wrong would have been
protected by suitable arguments; and when he was
hedged in by logical terms, and false appearances, you
must have owned yourself convinced before you could
then have got rid of him, and the shame of his triumph
had been added to the pain of his impertinence.</p>

<p>There is a sort of littleness in the minds of men of
wrong sense, which makes them much more insufferable
than mere fools, and has the further inconvenience of
being attended by an endless loquacity. For which
reason, it would be a very proper work, if some well-wisher
to human society would consider the terms upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
which people meet in public places, in order to prevent
the unseasonable declamations which we meet with there.
I remember, in my youth it was a humour at the University,
when a fellow pretended to be more eloquent than
ordinary, and had formed to himself a plot to gain all
our admiration, or triumph over us with an argument,
to either of which he had no manner of call; I say, in
either of these cases, it was the humour to shut one eye.
This whimsical way of taking notice to him of his absurdity,
has prevented many a man from being a coxcomb.
If amongst us on such an occasion each man offered a
voluntary rhetorician some snuff, it would probably produce
the same effect. As the matter now stands, whether
a man will or no, he is obliged to be informed in whatever
another pleases to entertain him with, though the
preceptor makes these advances out of vanity, and not to
instruct, but insult him.</p>

<p>There is no man will allow him who wants courage
to be called a soldier; but men who want good sense
are very frequently not only allowed to be scholars, but
esteemed for being such. At the same time it must be
granted, that as courage is the natural part of a soldier,
so is a good understanding of a scholar. Such little
minds as these, whose productions are collected in the
volume to which I have the honour to be patron, are
the instruments for artful men to work with, and become
popular with the unthinking part of mankind. In
courts, they make transparent flatterers; in camps, ostentatious
bullies; in colleges, unintelligible pedants; and their
faculties are used accordingly by those who lead them.</p>

<p>When a man who wants judgment is admitted into
the conversation of reasonable men, he shall remember
such improper circumstances, and draw such groundless
conclusions from their discourse, and that with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
colour of sense, as would divide the best set of company
that can be got together. It is just thus with a fool who
has a familiarity with books, he shall quote and recite
one author against another, in such a manner as shall
puzzle the best understanding to refute him; though
the most ordinary capacity may observe, that it is only
ignorance which makes the intricacy. All the true use
of that we call learning, is to ennoble and improve our
natural faculties, and not to disguise our imperfections.
It is therefore in vain for folly to attempt to conceal
itself by the refuge of learned languages. Literature
does but make a man more eminently the thing which
nature made him; and Polyglottes, had he studied less
than he has, and written only in his mother tongue, had
been known only in Great Britain for a pedant.</p>

book were a satire, directed against the clergy of the Catholic Church.
The letters, written by Ulrich von Hutten and his friends, purported
to be from certain monks and theologians to Ortuinus Gratius, doctor
of theology. They were intended to ridicule the bad Latin of the
clergy, and in every way to satirise the anti-reform party. (See
Bayle's "Dictionary," Arts. Hochstrat and Hutten; and <cite>Retrospective

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, July 14.</em><br />

<span class="smcap">The History of C&aelig;lia.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is not necessary to look back into the first years of
this young lady, whose story is of consequence only
as her life has lately met with passages very uncommon.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

She is now in the twentieth year of her age, and owes a
strict, but cheerful education, to the care of an aunt, to
whom she was recommended by her dying father, whose
decease was hastened by an inconsolable affliction for the
loss of her mother. As C&aelig;lia is the offspring of the
most generous passion that has been known in our age,
she is adorned with as much beauty and grace as the
most celebrated of her sex possess; but her domestic life,
moderate fortune, and religious education gave her but
little opportunity, and less inclination, to be admired in
public assemblies. Her abode has been for some years
a convenient distance from the Cathedral of St. Paul's,
where her aunt and she chose to reside, for the advantage
of that rapturous way of devotion which gives ecstasy to
the pleasures of innocence, and, in some measure, is the
immediate possession of those heavenly enjoyments for
which they are addressed.</p>

<p>As you may trace the usual thoughts of men in their
countenances, there appeared in the face of C&aelig;lia a
cheerfulness, the constant companion of unaffected virtue,
and a gladness, which is as inseparable from true piety.
Her every look and motion spoke the peaceful, mild,
resigning, humble inhabitant that animated her beauteous
body. Her air discovered her body a mere machine of
her mind, and not that her thoughts were employed in
studying graces and attractions for her person. Such
was C&aelig;lia when she was first seen by Palamede at her
usual place of worship. Palamede is a young man of
two-and-twenty, well-fashioned, learned, genteel, and discreet,
and son and heir of a gentleman of a very great
estate, and himself possessed of a plentiful one by the
gift of an uncle. He became enamoured with C&aelig;lia, and
after having learned her habitation, had address enough to
communicate his passion and circumstances with such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
air of good sense and integrity, as soon obtained permission
to visit and profess his inclinations towards her.
Palamede's present fortune and future expectations were
no way prejudicial to his addresses; but after the lovers
had passed some time in the agreeable entertainments
of a successful courtship, C&aelig;lia one day took occasion to
interrupt Palamede in the midst of a very pleasing discourse
of the happiness he promised himself in so accomplished
a companion, and assuming a serious air, told
him, there was another heart to be won before he gained
hers, which was that of his father. Palamede seemed
much disturbed at the overture, and lamented to her,
that his father was one of those too provident parents,
who only place their thoughts upon bringing riches into
their families by marriages, and are wholly insensible of
all other considerations. But the strictness of C&aelig;lia's
rules of life made her insist upon this demand; and the
son, at a proper hour, communicated to his father the
circumstances of his love, and the merit of the object.
The next day the father made her a visit. The beauty
of her person, the fame of her virtue, and a certain irresistible
charm in her whole behaviour on so tender and
delicate an occasion, wrought so much upon him, in spite
of all prepossessions, that he hastened the marriage with
an impatience equal to that of his son. Their nuptials
were celebrated with a privacy suitable to the character
and modesty of C&aelig;lia, and from that day, till a fatal one
of last week, they lived together with all the joy and
happiness which attend minds entirely united.</p>

<p>It should have been intimated, that Palamede is a
student of the Temple, and usually retired thither early
in a morning, C&aelig;lia still sleeping.</p>

<p>It happened a few days since, that she followed him
thither to communicate to him something she had omitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
in her redundant fondness to speak of the evening before.
When she came to his apartment, the servant there told
her, she was coming with a letter to her. While C&aelig;lia
in an inner room was reading an apology from her husband,
that he had been suddenly taken by some of his
acquaintance to dine at Brentford, but that he should
return in the evening, a country girl, decently clad,
asked, if those were not the chambers of Mr. Palamede?
She was answered, they were, but that he was
not in town. The stranger asked, when he was expected
at home? The servant replied, she would go in and ask
his wife. The young woman repeated the word "wife,"
and fainted. This accident raised no less curiosity than
amazement in C&aelig;lia, who caused her to be removed into
the inner room. Upon proper applications to revive her,
the unhappy young creature returned to herself, and said
to C&aelig;lia, with an earnest and beseeching tone, "Are you
really Mr. Palamede's wife?" C&aelig;lia replies, "I hope I
do not look as if I were any other in the condition you
see me." The stranger answers, "No, madam, he is my
husband." At the same instant she threw a bundle of
letters into C&aelig;lia's lap, which confirmed the truth of
what she asserted. Their mutual innocence and sorrow
made them look at each other as partners in distress,
rather than rivals in love. The superiority of C&aelig;lia's
understanding and genius gave her an authority to examine
into this adventure as if she had been offended
against, and the other the delinquent. The stranger
spoke in the following manner:</p>

<p>"Madam, if it shall please you, Mr. Palamede having
an uncle of a good estate near Winchester, was bred at the
school there, to gain the more his good-will by being in his
sight. His uncle died, and left him the estate, which
my husband now has. When he was a mere youth he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
set his affections on me: but when he could not gain his
ends he married me, making me and my mother, who is
a farmer's widow, swear we would never tell it upon any
account whatsoever; for that it would not look well for
him to marry such a one as me; besides, that his father
would cut him off of the estate. I was glad to have him
in an honest way, and he now and then came and stayed
a night and away at our house. But very lately he came
down to see us, with a fine young gentleman his friend,
who stayed behind there with us, pretending to like the
place for the summer; but ever since Master Palamede
went, he has attempted to abuse me; and I ran hither to
acquaint him with it, and avoid the wicked intentions of
his false friend."</p>

<p>C&aelig;lia had no more room for doubt, but left her rival
the same agonies she felt herself. Palamede returns
in the evening, and finding his wife at his chambers,
learned all that had passed, and hastened to C&aelig;lia's
lodgings.</p>

<p>It is much easier to imagine than express the sentiments
of either the criminal or the injured at this
encounter.</p>

<p>As soon as Palamede had found way for speech, he
confessed his marriage, and his placing his companion
on purpose to vitiate his wife, that he might break
through a marriage made in his nonage, and devote
his riper and knowing years to C&aelig;lia. She made him
no answer; but retired to her closet. He returned to
the Temple, where he soon after received from her the
following letter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"You, who this morning were the best, are now the
worst of men who breathe vital air. I am at
once overwhelmed with love, hatred, rage, and disdain.
Can infamy and innocence live together? I feel the
weight of the one too strong for the comfort of the
other. How bitter, Heaven, how bitter is my portion!
How much have I to say; but the infant which I bear
about me stirs with my agitation. I am, Palamede, to
live in shame, and this creature be heir to it. Farewell
for ever."</p>

From <em>Saturday, July 15</em>, to <em>Tuesday, July 18, 1710</em>.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">When we revolve in our thoughts such catastrophes
as that in the history of the unhappy C&aelig;lia,
there seems to be something so hazardous in the
changing a single state of life into that of marriage,
that (it may happen) all the precautions imaginable
are not sufficient to defend a virgin from ruin by her
choice. It seems a wonderful inconsistence in the
distribution of public justice, that a man who robs a
woman of an ear-ring or a jewel, should be punished
with death; but one who by false arts and insinuations
should take from her her very self, is only to suffer
disgrace. This excellent young woman has nothing
to console herself with, but the reflection that her
sufferings are not the effect of any guilt or misconduct,
and has for her protection the influence of a power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
which, amidst the unjust reproach of all mankind, can
give not only patience, but pleasure to innocence in
distress.</p>

<p>As the person who is the criminal against C&aelig;lia
cannot be sufficiently punished according to our present
law, so are there numberless unhappy persons without
remedy according to present custom. That great ill
which has prevailed among us in these latter ages, is
the making even beauty and virtue the purchase of
money. The generality of parents, and some of those
of quality, instead of looking out for introducing
health of constitution, frankness of spirit, or dignity
of countenance, into their families, lay out all their
thoughts upon finding out matches for their estates,
and not their children. You shall have one form a
plot for the good of his family, that there shall not
be six men in England capable of pretending to his
daughter. A second shall have a son obliged, out of
mere discretion, for fear of doing anything below
himself, follow all the drabs in town. These sage
parents meet; and as there is no pass, no courtship,
between the young ones, it is no unpleasant observation
to behold how they proceed to treaty. There is ever
in the behaviour of each something that denotes his
circumstance; and honest Coupler the conveniencer says,
he can distinguish upon sight of the parties, before
they have opened any point of their business, which of
the two has the daughter to sell. Coupler is of our
club, and I have frequently heard him declaim upon
this subject, and assert, that the marriage-settlements
which are now used have grown fashionable even within
his memory.</p>

<p>When the theatre in some late reigns owed its chief
support to those scenes which were written to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
matrimony out of countenance, and render that state
terrible, then it was that pin-money<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> first prevailed, and
all the other articles inserted which create a diffidence;
and intimate to the young people, that they are very
soon to be in a state of war with each other: though
this had seldom happened, except the fear of it had been
expressed. Coupler will tell you also, that jointures
were never frequent till the age before his own; but the
women were contented with the third part of the estate
the law allotted them, and scorned to engage with men
whom they thought capable of abusing their children.
He has also informed me, that those who were the oldest
benchers when he came to the Temple told him, the
first marriage-settlement of considerable length was the
invention of an old serjeant, who took the opportunity
of two testy fathers, who were ever squabbling to bring
about an alliance between their children. These fellows
knew each other to be knaves, and the serjeant took
hold of their mutual diffidence, for the benefit of the
law, to extend the settlement to three skins of parchment.</p>

<p>To this great benefactor to the profession is owing
the present price current of lines and words. Thus is
tenderness thrown out of the question; and the great
care is, what the young couple shall do when they come
to hate each other? I do not question but from this
one humour of settlements, might very fairly be deduced
not only our present defection in point of morals, but
also our want of people. This has given way to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
unreasonable gallantries, that a man is hardly reproachable
that deceives an innocent woman, though she has
never so much merit, if she is below him in fortune.
The man has no dishonour following his treachery; and
her own sex are so debased by force of custom, as to say
in the case of the woman, "How could she expect he
would marry her."</p>

<p>By this means the good offices, the pleasures and
graces of life, are not put into the balance: the bridegroom
has given his estate out of himself, and he has
no more left but to follow the blind decree of his fate,
whether he shall be succeeded by a sot, or a man of
merit, in his fortune. On the other side, a fine woman,
who has also a fortune, is set up by way of auction;
her first lover has ten to one against him. The very
hour after he has opened his heart and his rent-roll,
he is made no other use of, but to raise her price. She
and her friends lose no opportunity of publishing it
to call in new bidders. While the poor lover very
innocently waits till the plenipotentiaries at the Inns
of Court have debated about the alliance, all the
partisans of the lady throw difficulties in the way, till
other offers come in; and the man who came first is
not put in possession, till she has been refused by half
the town. If an abhorrence to such mercenary proceedings
were well settled in the minds of my fair
readers, those of merit would have a way opened to
their advancement; nay, those who abound in wealth
only, would in reality find their account in it. It
would not be in the power of their prude acquaintance,
their waiters, their nurses, cousins and whisperers, to
persuade them, that there are not above twenty men
in a kingdom (and those such as perhaps they may never
set eyes on) whom they can think of with discretion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
As the case stands now, let any one consider, how the
great heiresses, and those to whom they were offered,
for no other reason but that they could make them
suitable settlements, live together. What can be more
insipid, if not loathsome, than for two persons to be at
the head of a crowd, who have as little regard for them
as they for each other, and behold one another in an
affected sense of prosperity, without the least relish of
that exquisite gladness at meeting, that sweet inquietude
at parting, together with the charms of voice, look,
gesture, and that general benevolence between well-chosen
lovers, which makes all things please, and leaves
not the least trifle indifferent.</p>

<p>But I am diverted from these sketches for future
essays<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in behalf of my numerous clients of the fair sex,
by a notice sent to my office in Sheer Lane, that a blooming
widow, in the third year of her widowhood, and
twenty-sixth of her age, designs to take a colonel of
twenty-eight. The parties request I would draw up
their terms of coming together, as having a regard to
my opinion against long and diffident settlements; and I
have sent them the following indenture:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"We John &mdash;&mdash; and Mary &mdash;&mdash; having estates for life,
resolve to take each other. I John will venture my life
to enrich thee Mary; and I Mary will consult my health
to nurse thee John. To which we have interchangeably
set our hands, hearts, and seals, this 17th of July, 1710."</p>

From <em>Tuesday, July 18</em>, to <em>Thursday, July 20, 1710</em>.</h2>


<h3><em>From my own Apartment, July 19.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Having devoted the greater part of my time to the
service of the fair sex, I must ask pardon of my
men correspondents if I postpone their commands, when
I have any from the ladies which lie unanswered. That
which follows is of importance:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"You can't think it strange if I, who know little of
the world, apply to you for advice in the weighty
affair of matrimony, since you yourself have often declared
it to be of that consequence as to require the utmost
deliberation. Without further preface, therefore, give
me leave to tell you, that my father at his death left me
a fortune sufficient to make me a match for any gentleman.
My mother (for she is still alive) is very pressing
with me to marry; and I am apt to think, to gratify her,
I shall venture upon one of two gentlemen who at this
time make their addresses to me. My request is, that
you would direct me in my choice; which that you may
the better do, I shall give you their characters; and to
avoid confusion, desire you to call them by the names of
Philander and Silvius. Philander is young, and has a
good estate; Silvius is as young, and has a better. The
former has had a liberal education, has seen the town, is
retired from thence to his estate in the country, is a man
of few words, and much given to books. The latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
was brought up under his father's eye, who gave him just
learning enough to enable him to keep his accounts; but
made him withal very expert in country business, such as
ploughing, sowing, buying, selling, and the like. They
are both very sober men, neither of their persons is
disagreeable, nor did I know which to prefer till I
had heard them discourse; when the conversation of
Philander so much prevailed, as to give him the advantage,
with me, in all other respects. My mother pleads
strongly for Silvius, and uses these arguments, that he
not only has the larger estate at present, but by his good
husbandry and management increases it daily; that his
little knowledge in other affairs will make him easy and
tractable; whereas (according to her) men of letters know
too much to make good husbands. To part of this I
imagine I answer effectually, by saying, Philander's estate
is large enough; that they who think &pound;2000 a year sufficient,
make no difference between that and three. I
easily believe him less conversant in those affairs, the
knowledge of which she so much commends in Silvius;
but I think them neither so necessary or becoming in a
gentleman as the accomplishments of Philander. It is
no great character of a man to say, he rides in his coach
and six, and understands as much as he who follows his
plough. Add to this, that the conversation of these sort
of men seems so disagreeable to me, that though they
may make good bailiffs, I can hardly be persuaded they
can be good companions. It is possible I may seem to
have odd notions, when I say I am not fond of a man
only for being of (what is called) a thriving temper. To
conclude, I own I am at a loss to conceive how good
sense should make a man an ill husband, or conversing
with books less complaisant.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">C&aelig;lia.</span>"</p>

<p>The resolution which this lady is going to take, she
may very well say is founded on reason: for after the
necessities of life are served, there is no manner of
competition between a man of liberal education and an
illiterate. Men are not altered by their circumstances,
but as they give them opportunities of exerting what
they are in themselves; and a powerful clown is a tyrant
in the most ugly form he can possibly appear. There
lies a seeming objection in the thoughtful manner of
Philander: but let her consider which she shall oftener
have occasion to wish, that Philander would speak, or
Silvius hold his tongue.</p>

haste of another correspondent:</p>

<h3><em>The Amicable Contribution for raising the Fortunes
of Ten Young Ladies.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">"<em><span class="drop-cap">I</span>mprimis</em>, It is proposed to raise 100,000 crowns by
way of lots, which will advance for each lady
&pound;2500, which sum, together with one of the ladies, the
gentleman that shall be so happy as to draw a prize
(provided they both like), will be entitled to, under such
restrictions hereafter mentioned. And in case they do
not like, then either party that refuses shall be entitled
to &pound;1000 only, and the remainder to him or her that
shall be willing to marry, the man being first to declare
his mind. But it is provided, that if both parties shall
consent to have one another, the gentleman shall, before
he receives the money thus raised, settle &pound;1000 of the
same in substantial hands (who shall be as trustees for
the said ladies), and shall have the whole and sole disposal
of it for her use only.</p>

<p>"<em>Note.</em>&mdash;Each party shall have three months' time to
consider, after an interview had, which shall be within
ten days after the lots are drawn.</p>

<p>"<em>Note also.</em>&mdash;The name and place of abode of the
prize shall be placed on a proper ticket.</p>

<p>"<em>Item.</em>&mdash;They shall be ladies that have had a liberal
education, between fifteen and twenty-three, all genteel,
witty, and of unblamable characters.</p>

<p>"The money to be raised shall be kept in an iron
box, and when there shall be 2000 subscriptions, which
amounts to &pound;500, it shall be taken out and put into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
goldsmith's hands, and the note made payable to the
proper lady, or her assigns (with a clause therein to
hinder her from receiving it, till the fortunate person that
draws her shall first sign the note), and so on till the
whole sum is subscribed for: and as soon as 100,000
subscriptions are completed, and 200 crowns more to
pay the charges, the lottery shall be drawn at a proper
place, to be appointed a fortnight before the drawing."</p>

<p><em>Note.</em>&mdash;Mr. Bickerstaff objects to the marriageable years
here mentioned; and is of opinion, they should not commence
till after twenty-three. But he appeals to the
learned, both of Warwick Lane and Bishopsgate Street,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>

From <em>Thursday, July 20</em>, to <em>Saturday, July 22, 1710</em>.</h2>


<h3><em>White's Chocolate-house, July 21.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It has been often asserted in these papers, that the
great source of our wrong pursuits is the impertinent
manner with which we treat women, both in the common
and important circumstances of life. In vain do we say,
the whole sex would run into England, while the privileges
which are allowed them do no way balance the
inconveniences arising from those very immunities. Our
women have very much indulged to them in the participation
of our fortunes and our liberty; but the errors
they commit in the use of either, are by no means so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
impartially considered as the false steps which are made
by men. In the commerce of lovers, the man makes
the address, assails, and betrays, and yet stands in the
same degree of acceptance as he was in before he committed
that treachery: the woman, for no other crime
but believing one whom she thought loved her, is treated
with shyness and indifference at the best, and commonly
with reproach and scorn. He that is past the power of
beauty may talk of this matter with the same unconcern
as of any other subject: therefore I shall take upon me
to consider the sex, as they live within rules, and as they
transgress them. The ordinary class of the good or the
ill have very little influence upon the actions of others;
but the eminent in either kind are those who lead the
world below them. The ill are employed in communicating
scandal, infamy, and disease, like furies; the good
distribute benevolence, friendship, and health, like angels.
The ill are damped with pain and anguish at the sight
of all that is laudable, lovely, or happy. The virtuous
are touched with commiseration toward the guilty, the
disagreeable, and the wretched. There are those who
betray the innocent of their own sex, and solicit the
lewd of ours. There are those who have abandoned the
very memory, not only of innocence, but shame. There
are those who never forgave, nor could ever bear being
forgiven. There are also who visit the beds of the
sick, lull the cares of the sorrowful, and double the joys
of the joyful. Such is the destroying fiend, such the
guardian angel, woman.</p>

<p>The way to have a greater number of the amiable part
of womankind, and lessen the crowd of the other sort, is
to contribute what we can to the success of well-grounded
passions; and therefore I comply with the request of an
enamoured man in inserting the following billet:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Mr. Bickerstaff you always read, though me you will
never hear. I am obliged therefore to his compassion
for the opportunity of imploring yours. I sigh
for the most accomplished of her sex. That is so just a
distinction of her to whom I write, that the owning I
think so is no distinction of me who write. Your good
qualities are peculiar to you, my admiration in common
with thousands. I shall be present when you read this,
but fear every woman will take it for her character,
sooner than she who deserves it."</p>

<p>If the next letter which presents itself should come
from the mistress of this modest lover, and I make them
break through the oppression of their passions, I shall
expect gloves at their nuptials.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"You that are a philosopher know very well the make
of the mind of woman, and can best instruct me
in the conduct of an affair which highly concerns me. I
never can admit my lover to speak to me of love, yet
think him impertinent when he offers to talk of anything
else. What shall I do with a man that always believes
me? 'Tis a strange thing this distance in men of sense;
why do not they always urge their fate? If we are
sincere in our severity, you lose nothing by attempting.
If we are hypocrites, you certainly succeed."</p>


<h3><em>From my own Apartment, July 21.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Before I withdraw from business for the night, it is my
custom to receive all addresses to me, that others
may go to rest as well as myself, at least as far as I can
contribute to it. When I called to know if any would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
speak with me, I was informed that Mr. Mills,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the player,
desired to be admitted. He was so, and with much
modesty acquainted me, as he did other people of note,
that "Hamlet" was to be acted on Wednesday next for
his benefit. I had long wanted to speak with this person,
because I thought I could admonish him of many things
which would tend to his improvement. In the general I
observed to him, that though action was his business,
the way to that action was not to study gesture, for the
behaviour would follow the sentiments of the mind.</p>

<p>Action to the player, is what speech is to an orator.
If the matter be well conceived, words will flow with
ease; and if the actor is well possessed of the nature of
his part, a proper action will necessarily follow. He informed
me, that Wilks was to act Hamlet. I desired
him, to request of him in my name, that he would wholly
forget Mr. Betterton; for that he failed in no part of
Othello, but where he had him in view. An actor's
forming himself by the carriage of another, is like the
trick among the widows, who lament their husbands as
their neighbours did theirs, and not according to their
own sentiments of the deceased.</p>

<p>There is a fault also in the audience which interrupts
their satisfaction very much, that is, the figuring to
themselves the actor in some part wherein they formerly
particularly liked him, and not attending to the part he
is at that time performing. Thus, whatever Wilks (who
is the strictest follower of nature) is acting, the vulgar
spectators turn their thoughts upon Sir Harry Wildair.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>When I had indulged the loquacity of an old man for
some time in such loose hints, I took my leave of Mr.
Mills, and was told, Mr. Elliot<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of St. James's Coffee-house
would speak with me. His business was to desire
I would, as I am an astrologer, let him know beforehand
who were to have the benefit tickets in the ensuing
lottery; which knowledge he was of opinion he could
turn to great account, as he was concerned in news.</p>

<p>I granted his request, upon an oath of secrecy, that he
would only make his own use of it, and not let it be
publicly known till after they were drawn. I had not
done speaking, when he produced to me a plan which he
had formed of keeping books, with the names of all such
adventurers, and the numbers of their tickets, as should
come to him, in order to give an hourly account<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of
what tickets shall come up during the whole time of the
lottery, the drawing of which is to begin on Wednesday
next. I liked his method of disguising the secret I had
told him, and pronounced him a thriving man who could
so well watch the motion of things, and profit by a prevailing
humour and impatience so aptly, as to make his
honest industry agreeable to his customers, as it is to be
the messenger of their good fortune.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, July 24.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">This afternoon I went to visit a gentleman of my
acquaintance at Mile End, and passing through
Stepney Churchyard, I could not forbear entertaining
myself with the inscriptions on the tombs and graves.
Among others, I observed one with this notable memorial:</p>

<p class="center">"Here lies the body of T.B."
</p>

<p>This fantastical desire of being remembered only by the
two first letters of a name, led me into the contemplation
of the vanity and imperfect attainments of ambition in
general. When I run back in my imagination all the
men whom I have ever known and conversed with in my
whole life, there are but very few who have not used
their faculties in the pursuit of what it is impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
acquire, or left the possession of what they might have
been (at their setting out) masters, to search for it where
it was out of their reach. In this thought it was not
possible to forget the instance of Pyrrhus, who proposing
to himself in discourse with a philosopher,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> one, and
another, and another conquest, was asked, what he would
do after all that? "Then," says the King, "we will
make merry." He was well answered, "What hinders
your doing that in the condition you are already?" The
restless desire of exerting themselves above the common
level of mankind is not to be resisted in some tempers;
and minds of this make may be observed in every
condition of life. Where such men do not make to
themselves or meet with employment, the soil of their
constitution runs into tares and weeds. An old friend of
mine, who lost a major's post forty years ago, and quitted,
has ever since studied maps, encampments, retreats, and
countermarches, with no other design but to feed his
spleen and ill-humour, and furnish himself with matter
for arguing against all the successful actions of others.
He that at his first setting out in the world was the
gayest man in our regiment, ventured his life with alacrity,
and enjoyed it with satisfaction, encouraged men below
him, and was courted by men above him, has been ever
since the most froward creature breathing. His warm
complexion spends itself now only in a general spirit of
contradiction; for which he watches all occasions, and is
in his conversation still upon sentry, treats all men like
enemies, with every other impertinence of a speculative
warrior.</p>

<p>He that observes in himself this natural inquietude,
should take all imaginable care to put his mind in some
method of gratification, or he will soon find himself grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
into the condition of this disappointed major. Instead
of courting proper occasions to rise above others, he will
be ever studious of pulling others down to him: it being
the common refuge of disappointed ambition, to ease
themselves by detraction. It would be no great argument
against ambition, that there are such mortal things
in the disappointment of it; but it certainly is a forcible
exception, that there can be no solid happiness in the
success of it. If we value popular praise, it is in the
power of the meanest of the people to disturb us by
calumny. If the fame of being happy, we cannot look
into a village but we see crowds in actual possession of
what we seek only the appearance. To this may be
added, that there is I know not what malignity in the
minds of ordinary men to oppose you in what they see
you fond of; and it is a certain exception against a man's
receiving applause, that he visibly courts it. However,
this is not only the passion of great and undertaking
spirits, but you see it in the lives of such as one would
believe were far enough removed from the ways of
ambition. The rural squires of this nation even eat and
drink out of vanity. A vainglorious fox-hunter shall
entertain half a county for the ostentation of his beef
and beer, without the least affection for any of the crowd
about him. He feeds them, because he thinks it a
superiority over them that he does so: and they devour
him, because they know he treats them out of insolence.
This indeed is ambition in grotesque, but may figure to
us the condition of politer men, whose only pursuit is
glory. When the superior acts out of a principle of
vanity, the dependant will be sure to allow it him;
because he knows it destructive of the very applause
which is courted by the man who favours him, and consequently
makes him nearer himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>But as every man living has more or less of this
incentive, which makes men impatient of an inactive
condition, and urges men to attempt what may tend to
their reputation, it is absolutely necessary they should
form to themselves an ambition which is in every man's
power to gratify. This ambition would be independent,
and would consist only in acting what to a man's own
mind appears most great and laudable. It is a pursuit
in the power of every man, and is only a regular prosecution
of what he himself approves. It is what can be
interrupted by no outward accidents, for no man can be
robbed of his good intention. One of our society of the
Trumpet therefore started last night a notion which I
thought had reason in it. "It is, methinks," said he,
"an unreasonable thing, that heroic virtue should (as it
seems to be at present) be confined to a certain order of
men, and be attainable by none but those whom fortune
has elevated to the most conspicuous stations. I would
have everything to be esteemed as heroic which is great
and uncommon in the circumstances in the man who
performs it." Thus there would be no virtue in human
life which every one of the species would not have a
pretence to arrive at, and an ardency to exert. Since
Fortune is not in our power, let us be as little as possible
in hers. Why should it be necessary that a man should
be rich, to be generous? If we measured by the quality,
and not the quantity, of things, the particulars which
accompany an action are what should denominate it mean
or great. The highest station of human life is to be
attained by each man that pretends to it: for every man
can be as valiant, as generous, as wise, and as merciful, as
the faculties and opportunities which he has from Heaven
and fortune will permit. He that can say to himself, I
do as much good, and am as virtuous, as my most earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
endeavours will allow me, whatever is his station in the
world, is to himself possessed of the highest honour. If
ambition is not thus turned, it is no other than a continual
succession of anxiety and vexation. But when it
has this cast, it invigorates the mind, and the consciousness
of its own worth is a reward which it is not in the
power of envy, reproach, or detraction, to take from it.
Thus the seat of solid honour is in a man's own bosom,
and no one can want support who is in possession of an
honest conscience, but he who would suffer the reproaches
of it for other greatness.</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em>&mdash;I was going on in my philosophy, when notice
was brought me that there was a great crowd in my
ante-chamber, who expected audience. When they were
admitted, I found they all met at my lodgings; each
coming upon the same errand, to know whether they
were of the fortunate in the lottery, which is now ready
to be drawn. I was much at a loss how to extricate myself
from their importunity; but observing the assembly
made up of both sexes, I signified to them, that in this
case it would appear Fortune is not blind, for all the lots
would fall upon the wisest and the fairest. This gave
so general a satisfaction, that the room was soon emptied,
and the company retired with the best air, and the most
pleasing grace, I had anywhere observed. Mr. Elliot<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of
St. James's Coffee-house now stood alone before me,
and signified to me, he had now not only prepared his
books, but had received a very great subscription already.
His design was, to advertise his subscribers at their
respective places of abode, within an hour after their
number is drawn, whether it was a blank or benefit, if
the adventurer lives within the bills of mortality; if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>he dwells in the country, by the next post. I encouraged
the man in his industry, and told him, the ready
path to good fortune was to believe there was no
such thing.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, July 26.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is natural for the imaginations of men who lead
their lives in too solitary a manner, to prey upon
themselves, and form from their own conceptions beings
and things which have no place in nature. This often
makes an adept as much at a loss when he comes into
the world as a mere savage. To avoid therefore that
ineptitude for society, which is frequently the fault of us
scholars, and has to men of understanding and breeding
something much more shocking and untractable than
rusticity itself, I take care to visit all public solemnities,
and go into assemblies as often as my studies will permit.
This being therefore the first day of the drawing of the
lottery,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> I did not neglect spending a considerable time
in the crowd: but as much a philosopher as I pretend to
be, I could not but look with a sort of veneration upon
the two boys which received the tickets from the wheels,
as the impartial and equal dispensers of the fortunes
which were to be distributed among the crowd, who all
stood expecting the same chance. It seems at first
thought very wonderful, that one passion should so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>universally have the pre-eminence of another in the
possession of men's minds as that in this case; all in
general have a secret hope of the great ticket: and yet
fear in another instance, as in going into a battle, shall
have so little influence, as that though each man believes
there will be many thousands slain, each is confident
he himself shall escape. This certainty proceeds from
our vanity; for every man sees abundance in himself
that deserves reward, and nothing which should meet
with mortification. But of all the adventurers that
filled the hall, there was one who stood by me, who
I could not but fancy expected the thousand pounds
per annum, as a mere justice to his parts and industry.
He had his pencil and table-book, and was at the drawing
of each lot, counting how much a man with seven
tickets was now nearer the great prize, by the striking
out another and another competitor. This man was of
the most particular constitution I had ever observed;
his passions were so active, that he worked in the utmost
stretch of hope and fear. When one rival fell before
him, you might see a short gleam of triumph in his
countenance, which immediately vanished at the approach
of another. What added to the particularity of this
man, was, that he every moment cast a look, either
upon the commissioners, the wheels, or the boys. I
gently whispered him, and asked, when he thought the
thousand pounds would come up? "Pugh!" says he,
"who knows that?" and then looks upon a little list
of his own tickets, which were pretty high in their
numbers, and said it would not come this ten days.
This fellow will have a good chance, though not that
which he has put his heart on. The man is mechanically
turned, and made for getting. The simplicity and
eagerness which he is in, argues an attention to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
point; though what he is labouring at does not in the
least contribute to it. Were it not for such honest
fellows as these, the men who govern the rest of their
species would have no tools to work with: for the
outward show of the world is carried on by such as
cannot find out that they are doing nothing. I left my
man with great reluctance, seeing the care he took to
observe the whole conduct of the persons concerned, and
compute the inequality of the chances with his own
hands and eyes. "Dear sir," said I, "they must rise
early that cheat you." "Ay," said he, "there's nothing
like a man's minding his business himself." "'Tis very
true," said I; "the master's eye makes the horse fat."</p>

<p>As it is much the greater number who are to go
without prizes, it is but very expedient to turn our
lecture<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> to the forming just sentiments on the subject
of fortune. One said this morning, that the chief lot
he was confident would fall upon some puppy; but this
gentleman is one of those wrong tempers who approve
only the unhappy, and have a natural prejudice to the
fortunate. But as it is certain that there is a great
meanness in being attached to a man purely for his
fortune, there is no less a meanness in disliking him for
his happiness. It is the same perverseness under different
colours, and both these resentments arise from mere
pride.</p>

<p>The true greatness of mind consists in valuing men
apart from their circumstances, or according to their
behaviour in them. Wealth is a distinction only in
traffic; but it must not be allowed as a recommendation
in any other particular, but only just as it is
applied. It was very prettily said, that we may learn
the little value of fortune by the persons on whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Heaven is pleased to bestow it.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> However, there is not
a harder part in human life than becoming wealth and
greatness. He must be very well stocked with merit,
who is not willing to draw some superiority over his
friends from his fortune: for it is not every man that
can entertain with the air of a guest, and do good offices
with the mien of one that receives them.</p>

<p>I must confess, I cannot conceive how a man can
place himself in a figure wherein he can so much enjoy
his own soul, and that greatest of pleasures, the just
approbation of his own actions, than as an adventurer
on this occasion, to sit and see the lots go off without
hope or fear, perfectly unconcerned as to himself, but
taking part in the good fortune of others.</p>

<p>I will believe there are happy tempers in being, to
whom all the good that arrives to any of their fellow-creatures
gives a pleasure. These live in a course of
substantial and lasting happiness, and have the satisfaction
to see all men endeavour to gratify them. This
state of mind not only lets a man into certain enjoyments,
but relieves him from as certain anxieties. If you will
not rejoice with happy men, you must repine at them.
Dick Reptile alluded to this when he said, he would
hate no man out of pure idleness. As for my own part,
I look at fortune quite in another view than the rest of
the world; and, by my knowledge in futurity, tremble
at the approaching prize which I see coming to a young
lady for whom I have much tenderness; and have therefore
written her the following letter, to be sent by Mr.
Elliot with the notice of her ticket:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"You receive at the instant this comes to your hands,
an account of your having (what only you wanted)
fortune; and to admonish you, that you may not now
want everything else. You had yesterday wit, virtue,
beauty; but you never heard of them till to-day. They
say Fortune is blind; but you will find she has opened
the eyes of all your beholders. I beseech you, madam,
make use of the advantages of having been educated
without flattery. If you can still be Chloe, Fortune has
indeed been kind to you; if you are altered, she has it

<p class="drop-cap">"I have been this summer upon a ramble to visit
several friends and relations; which is the reason

South Wales, so long in your error concerning the grass-plots

of my gardener's conduct in the management

you know, that my little fields within doors, though by

roll them. Grass and herbs in general, the less they

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, July 28.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Many are the inconveniences which happen from the
improper manner of address in common speech
between persons of the same or of different quality.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Among these errors, there is none greater than that of
the impertinent use of title, and a paraphrastical way
of saying "you." I had the curiosity the other day to
follow a crowd of people near Billingsgate, who were
conducting a passionate woman who sold fish to a magistrate,
in order to explain some words which were ill
taken by one of her own quality and profession in the
public market. When she came to make her defence,
she was so very full of, "his Worship," and of, "if it
should please his Honour," that we could for some time
hardly hear any other apology she made for herself than
that of atoning for the ill language she had been accused
of towards her neighbour by the great civilities she paid
to her judge. But this extravagance in her sense of doing
honour, was no more to be wondered at than that her
many rings on each finger were worn as instances of finery
and dress. The vulgar may thus heap and huddle terms
of respect, and nothing better be expected from them;
but for people of rank to repeat appellatives insignificantly,
is a folly not to be endured, neither with regard
to our times or our understanding. It is below the dignity
of speech to extend it with more words or phrases
than are necessary to explain ourselves with elegance:
and it is, methinks, an instance of ignorance, if not of
servitude, to be redundant in such expressions.</p>

<p>I waited upon a man of quality some mornings ago:
he happened to be dressing; and his shoemaker fitting
him, told him, that if his Lordship would please to tread
hard, or that if his Lordship would stamp a little, his
Lordship would find his Lordship's shoe will fit as easy
as any piece of work his Lordship should see in England.
As soon as my lord was dressed, a gentleman approached
him with a very good air, and told him, he had an affair
which had long depended in the Lower Courts, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
through the inadvertency of his ancestors on the one side,
and the ill arts of their adversaries on the other, could
not possibly be settled according to the rules of the Lower
Courts: that therefore he designed to bring his cause
before the House of Lords next session, where he should
be glad if his Lordship should happen to be present;
for he doubted not but his cause would be approved by
all men of justice and honour. In this place the word
"Lordship" was gracefully inserted, because it was applied
to him in that circumstance wherein his quality was the
occasion of the discourse, and wherein it was most useful
to the one, and most honourable to the other.</p>

<p>This way is so far from being disrespectful to the
honour of nobles, that it is an expedient for using them
with greater deference. I would not put "Lordship" to
a man's hat, gloves, wig, or cane; but to desire his Lordship's
favour, his Lordship's judgment, or his Lordship's
patronage, is a manner of speaking which expresses an
alliance between his quality and his merit. It is this
knowledge which distinguished the discourse of the shoemaker
from that of the gentleman. The highest point
of good-breeding, if any one can hit it, is to show a very
nice regard to your own dignity, and with that in your
heart express your value for the man above you.</p>

<p>But the silly humour to the contrary has so much prevailed,
that the slavish addition of title enervates discourse,
and renders the application of it almost ridiculous.
We writers of diurnals are nearer in our styles to that of
common talk than any other writers, by which means we
use words of respect sometimes very unfortunately. The
<cite>Post-Man</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> who is one of the most celebrated of our
fraternity, fell into this misfortune yesterday in his paragraph
from Berlin of July 26. "Count Wartenberg,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>says he, "Great Chamberlain, and Chief Minister of this
Court, who on Monday last accompanied the King of
Prussia to Oranienburg, was taken so very ill, that on
Wednesday his life was despaired of; and we had a
report, that his Excellency was dead."</p>

<p>I humbly presume, that it flattens the narration, to say
"his Excellency" in a case which is common to all men;
except you would infer what is not to be inferred, to wit,
that the author designed to say, "all wherein he excelled
others was departed from him."</p>

<p>Were distinctions used according to the rules of reason
and sense, those additions to men's names would be, as
they were first intended, significant of their worth, and
not their persons; so that in some cases it might be
proper to say, "The man is dead, but his excellency will
never die." It is, methinks, very unjust to laugh at a
Quaker, because he has taken up a resolution to treat
you with a word, the most expressive of complaisance
that can be thought of, and with an air of good-nature
and charity calls you friend. I say, it is very unjust to
rally him for this term to a stranger, when you yourselves,
in all your phrases of distinction, confound phrases
of honour into no use at all.</p>

<p>Tom Courtly, who is the pink of courtesy, is an instance
of how little moment an undistinguishing application
of sounds of honour are to those who understand
themselves. Tom never fails of paying his obeisance to
every man he sees, who has title or office to make him
conspicuous; but his deference is wholly given to outward
considerations. I, who know him, can tell within
half an acre how much land one man has more than
another by Tom's bow to him. Title is all he knows of
honour, and civility of friendship: for this reason, because
he cares for no man living, he is religiously strict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
in performing what he calls his respects to you. To this
end he is very learned in pedigree, and will abate something
in the ceremony of his approaches to a man, if he is
in any doubt about the bearing of his coat of arms. What
is the most pleasant of all his character is, that he acts
with a sort of integrity in these impertinences; and
though he would not do any man any solid kindness, he
is wonderfully just and careful not to wrong his quality.
But as integrity is very scarce in the world, I cannot forbear
having respect for the impertinent: it is some virtue
to be bound by anything. Tom and I are upon very
good terms for the respect he has for the house of Bickerstaff.
Though one cannot but laugh at his serious consideration
of things so little essential, one must have a
value even for a frivolous good conscience.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, July 31.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Nature has implanted in us two very strong desires,
hunger for the preservation of the individual, and
lust for the support of the species; or, to speak more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
intelligibly, the former to continue our own persons,
and the latter to introduce others into the world.
According as men behave themselves with regard to
these appetites, they are above or below the beasts of
the field, which are incited by them without choice
or reflection. But reasonable creatures correct these
incentives, and improve them into elegant motives of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>friendship and society. It is chiefly from this homely
foundation, that we are under the necessity of seeking
for the agreeable companion, and the honourable
mistress. By this cultivation of art and reason, our
wants are made pleasures, and the gratification of our
desires, under proper restrictions, a work no way below
our noblest faculties. The wisest man may maintain
his character, and yet consider in what manner he shall
best entertain his friend, or divert his mistress: nay,
it is so far from being a derogation to him, that he
can in no other instances show so true a taste of his
life or his fortune. What concerns one of the above-mentioned
appetites, as it is elevated into love, I shall
have abundant occasion to discourse of before I have
provided for the numberless crowd of damsels I have
proposed to take care of. The subject therefore of the
present paper shall be that part of society which owes
its beginning to the common necessity of hunger.
When this is considered as the support of our being,
we may take in under the same head thirst also; otherwise
when we are pursuing the glutton, the drunkard
may make his escape. The true choice of our diet,
and our companions at it, seems to consist in that which
contributes most to cheerfulness and refreshment: and
these certainly are best consulted by simplicity in the
food, and sincerity in the company. By this rule are
in the first place excluded from pretence to happiness
all meals of state and ceremony, which are performed
in dumb show and greedy sullenness. At the boards of
the great, they say, you shall have a number attending
with as good habits and countenances as the guests,
which only circumstance must destroy the whole pleasure
of the repast: for if such attendants are introduced for
the dignity of their appearance, modest minds are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
shocked by considering them as spectators, or else look
upon them as equals, for whose servitude they are in
a kind of suffering. It may be here added, that the
sumptuous sideboard to an ingenuous eye has often more
the air of an altar than a table. The next absurd way
of enjoying ourselves at meals, is, where the bottle is
plied without being called for, where humour takes
place of appetite, and the good company are too dull
or too merry to know any enjoyment in their senses.</p>

<p>Though this part of time is absolutely necessary to
sustain life, it must be also considered, that life itself
is to the endless being of man but what a meal is to
this life, not valuable for itself, but for the purpose
of it. If there be any truth in this, the expense of
many hours this way is somewhat unaccountable; and
placing much thought either in too great sumptuousness
and elegance in this matter, or wallowing in noise and
riot at it, are both, though not equally, unaccountable.
I have often considered these different people with very
great attention, and always speak of them with the
distinction of the eaters and the swallowers. The
eaters sacrifice all their senses and understanding to this
appetite: the swallowers hurry themselves out of both,
without pleasing this or any other appetite at all.
The latter are improved brutes, the former degenerated
men. I have sometimes thought it would not be
improper to add to my dead and living men, persons
in an intermediate state of humanity, under the appellation
of dozers. The dozers are a sect, who, instead of
keeping their appetites in subjection, live in subjection
to them; nay, they are so truly slaves to them, that
they keep at too great a distance ever to come into their
presence. Within my own acquaintance, I know those
that I daresay have forgot that they ever were hungry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and are no less utter strangers to thirst and weariness,
who are beholden to sauces for their food, and to their
food for their weariness.</p>

<p>I have often wondered, considering the excellent and
choice spirits that we have among our divines, that
they do not think of putting vicious habits into a more
contemptible and unlovely figure than they do at present.
So many men of wit and spirit as there are in sacred
orders, have it in their power to make the fashion of
their side. The leaders in human society are more
effectually prevailed upon this way than can easily be
imagined. I have more than one in my thoughts at
this time capable of doing this against all the opposition
of the most witty, as well as the most voluptuous.
There may possibly be more acceptable subjects, but
sure there are none more useful. It is visible, that
though men's fortunes, circumstances, and pleasures
give them prepossessions too strong to regard any
mention either of punishments or rewards, they will
listen to what makes them inconsiderable or mean in
the imaginations of others, and by degrees in their own.</p>

<p>It is certain such topics are to be touched upon in
the light we mean, only by men of the most consummate
prudence, as well as excellent wit: for these discourses
are to be made, if made to run into example, before
such as have their thoughts more intent upon the propriety
than the reason of the discourse. What indeed
leads me into this way of thinking, is, that the last
thing I read was a sermon of the learned Dr. South,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
upon the Ways of Pleasantness. This admirable discourse
was made at court, where the preacher was too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>wise a man not to believe; the greatest argument, in
that place, against the pleasures then in vogue, must
be, that they lost greater pleasures by prosecuting the
course they were in. The charming discourse has in it
whatever wit and wisdom can put together. This
gentleman has a talent of making all his faculties bear
to the great end of his hallowed profession. Happy
genius! he is the better man for being a wit. The
best way to praise this author is to quote him; and,
I think, I may defy any man to say a greater thing of
him, or his ability, than that there are no paragraphs
in the whole discourse I speak of below these which
follow.</p>

<p>After having recommended the satisfaction of the
mind, and the pleasure of conscience, he proceeds:</p>

<p>"An ennobling property of it is, that it is such a
pleasure as never satiates or wearies; for it properly
affects the spirit, and a spirit feels no weariness, as being
privileged from the causes of it. But can the epicure
say so of any of the pleasures he so much dotes upon?
Do they not expire while they satisfy, and after a few
minutes' refreshment determine in loathing and unquietness?
How short is the interval between a pleasure and
a burden! How undiscernible the transition from one
to the other! Pleasure dwells no longer upon the appetite
than the necessities of nature, which are quickly and
easily provided for; and then all that follows is a load
and an oppression. Every morsel to a satisfied hunger
is only a new labour to a tired digestion. Every draught
to him that has quenched his thirst is but a further
quenching of nature, and a provision for rheum and
diseases, a drowning of the quickness and activity of the
spirits.</p>

<p>"He that prolongs his meals, and sacrifices his time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
as well as his other conveniences, to his luxury, how
quickly does he outsit his pleasure! And then, how is
all the following time bestowed upon ceremony and
surfeit! Till at length, after a long fatigue of eating,
and drinking, and babbling, he concludes the great work
of dining genteelly, and so makes a shift to rise from
table, that he may lie down upon his bed; where, after
he has slept himself into some use of himself, by much
ado he staggers to his table again, and there acts over
the same brutish scene: so that he passes his whole life
in a dozed condition, between sleeping and waking, with
a kind of drowsiness and confusion upon his senses,
which, what pleasure it can be, is hard to conceive. All
that is of it dwells upon the tip of his tongue, and
within the compass of his palate. A worthy prize for a
man to purchase with the loss of his time, his reason,
and himself!"</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Samuel Partiger Fuller was M.P. for Petersfield from 1715 to
1722. Steele's letters show that he was an intimate friend of Fuller's
in 1716-17; and in February 1716, when Steele spoke in the House
of Commons on behalf of the noblemen condemned for the part
they had taken in the rebellion of 1715, he was seconded by Fuller.
The following passage from Steele's <cite>Theatre</cite>, No. 26, March 29,
1720, is the authority for attributing this paper to young Fuller, then
a secret correspondent:
</p>
<p>
"I can hardly conceive a more laudable act, than declaring an
abhorrence of so fashionable a crime [viz., duelling], which weakness,
cowardice, and an impatience of the reproach of fools, have brought
upon reasonable men. This sort of behaviour cannot proceed but
from a true and undaunted courage; and I cannot but have in great
veneration a generous youth, who, in public, declared his assent and
concurrence to this law, by saying, that in spite of the prevailing
custom, he triumphed more in being a second to prevent, than he
should have done in being one to promote murder. A speech thus
ingenuous could come only from a heart that scorned reserves, in
compliance to falsehood, to do injury to truth.
</p>
<p>
"This was true greatness of mind; and the man who did it,
could not possibly do it for his own sake, but must be conscious of a
courage sufficient for his own defence, who could thus candidly, at
this time of life, rescue other men from the necessity of bearing
contempt, or doing an ill action.
</p>
<p>
"The mind usually exerts itself in all its faculties with an equal
pace towards maturity; and this gentleman, who at the age of
sixteen could form such pleasant pictures of the false and little
ambitions of low spirits, as Mr. Fuller did, to whom, when a boy,
we owe, with several other excellent pieces, "The Vainglorious
Glutton," when a secret correspondent of the <cite>Tatler</cite>: I say, such a
one might easily, as he proceeded in human life, arrive at this
superior strength of mind at four-and-twenty. The soul that labours
against prejudice, and follows reason, ripens in her capacities and
grows in her talents at the same time. As therefore courage is what
a man attains by thought, as much as he improves his wit by study,
it is only from want of opportunities to call the one or the other
forth, and draw the respective qualities into habit, if ever a man of
sense is a coward."</p></div>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Aug. 2.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The general purposes of men in the conduct of their
lives (I mean with relation to this life only), end
in gaining either the affection or the esteem of those
with whom they converse. Esteem makes a man powerful
in business, and affection desirable in conversation;
which is certainly the reason that very agreeable men fail
of their point in the world, and those who are by no
means such arrive at it with much ease. If it be visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
in a man's carriage that he has a strong passion to please,
no one is much at a loss how to keep measures with him,
because there is always a balance in people's hands to
make up with him, by giving him what he still wants in
exchange for what you think fit to deny him. Such a
person asks with diffidence, and ever leaves room for
denial by that softness of his complexion. At the same
time he himself is capable of denying nothing, even what
he is not able to perform. The other sort of man who
courts esteem, having a quite different view, has as
different a behaviour, and acts as much by the dictates
of his reason, as the other does by the impulse of his
inclination. You must pay for everything you have of
him. He considers mankind as a people in commerce,
and never gives out of himself what he is sure will not
come in with interest from another. All his words and
actions tend to the advancement of his reputation and
of his fortune, toward which he makes hourly progress,
because he lavishes no part of his good-will upon such as
do not make some advances to merit it. The man who
values affection sometimes becomes popular, he who aims
at esteem seldom fails of growing rich.</p>

<p>Thus far we have looked at these different men as
persons who endeavour to be valued and beloved from
design or ambition; but they appear in quite another
figure, when you observe the men who are agreeable and
venerable from the force of their natural inclinations.
We affect the company of him who has least regard
of himself in his carriage, who throws himself into
unguarded gaiety, voluntary mirth, and general good-humour;
who has nothing in his head but the present
hour, and seems to have all his interests and passions
gratified, if every man else in the room is as unconcerned
as himself. This man usually has no quality or character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
among his companions; let him be born of whom he will,
have what great qualities he please, let him be capable of
assuming for a moment what figure he pleases, he still
dwells in the imagination of all who know him but as
Jack Such-a-One. This makes Jack brighten up the
room wherever he enters, and change the severity of the
company into that gaiety and good-humour into which
his conversation generally leads them. It is not unpleasant
to observe even this sort of creature go out
of his character, to check himself sometimes for his
familiarities, and pretend so awkwardly at procuring to
himself more esteem than he finds he meets with. I
was the other day walking with Jack Gainly towards
Lincoln's Inn Walks. We met a fellow who is a lower
officer where Jack is in the direction. Jack cries to him,
so, "How is it, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;?" He answers, "Mr. Gainly,
I am glad to see you well." This expression of equality
gave my friend a pang, which appeared in a flush of his
countenance. "Prithee, Jack," says I, "do not be angry
at the man; for do what you will, the man can only love
you: be contented with the image the man has of thee;
for if thou aimest at any other, it must be hatred or
contempt." I went on, and told him, "Look'ee, Jack,
I have heard thee sometimes talk like an oracle for half-an-hour,
with the sentiments of a Roman, the closeness
of a school-man, and the integrity of a divine; but then,
Jack, while I admired thee, it was upon topics which did
not concern thyself, and where the greatness of the subject
(added to thy being personally unconcerned in it)
created all that was great in thy discourse." I did not
mind his being a little out of humour, but comforted
him, by giving him several instances of men of our
acquaintance, who had no one quality in any eminence,
that were much more esteemed than he was with very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
many: but the thing is, if your character is to give
pleasure, men will consider you only in that light, and
not in those acts which turn to esteem and veneration.</p>

<p>When I think of Jack Gainly, I cannot but reflect also
upon his sister Gatty. She is young, witty, pleasant,
innocent. This is her natural character; but when she
observes any one admired for what they call a fine
woman, she is all the next day womanly, prudent, observing,
and virtuous. She is every moment asked in
her prudential behaviour, whether she is not well?
Upon which she as often answers in a fret, "Do people
think one must be always romping, always a Jack-pudding?"
I never fail to inquire of her, if my Lady
Such-a-One, that awful beauty, was not at the play last
night? She knows the connection between that question
and her change of humour, and says, "It would be very
well, if some people would examine into themselves as
much as they do into others;" or, "Sure there is nothing
in the world so ridiculous as an amorous old man."</p>

<p>As I was saying, there is a class which every man is in
by his post in nature, from which it is impossible for him
to withdraw to another, and become it. Therefore it is
necessary that each should be contented with it, and not
endeavour at any progress out of that tract. To follow
nature, is the only agreeable course; which is what I
would fain inculcate to those jarring companions, Flavia
and Lucia. They are mother and daughter. Flavia, who
is the mamma, has all the charms and desires of youth
still about her, and not much turned of thirty: Lucia is
blooming and amorous, and but a little above fifteen.
The mother looks very much younger than she is, the
girl very much older. If it were possible to fix the girl
to her sick-bed, and preserve the portion (the use of
which the mother partakes), the good widow Flavia would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
certainly do it. But for fear of Lucia's escape, the
mother is forced to be constantly attended with a rival,
that explains her age, and draws off the eyes of her
admirers. The jest is, they can never be together in
strangers' company, but Lucy is eternally reprimanded
for something very particular in her behaviour; for which
she has the malice to say, she hopes she shall always obey
her parents. She carried her passion and jealousy to that
height the other day, that coming suddenly into the room,
and surprising Colonel Lofty speaking rapture on one
knee to her mother, she clapped down by him and
asked her blessing.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it is so proper to tell family
occurrences of this nature; but we every day see the
same thing happen in the public conversation in the
world. Men cannot be contented with what is laudable,
but they must have all that is laudable. This affectation
is what destroys the familiar man into pretences to take
state upon him, and the contrary character to the folly of
aiming at being winning and complaisant. But in these
cases men may easily lay aside what they are, but can
never arrive at what they are not.</p>

<p>As to the pursuits after affection and esteem, the fair
sex are happy in this particular, that with them the one
is much more nearly related to the other than in men.
The love of a woman is inseparable from some esteem of
her; and as she is naturally the object of affection, the
woman who has your esteem has also some degree of
your love.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> A man that dotes on a woman for her
beauty, will whisper his friend, "That creature has a
great deal of wit when you are well acquainted with her."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
And if you examine the bottom of your esteem for a
woman, you will find you have a greater opinion of her
beauty than anybody else. As to us men, I design to
pass most of my time with the facetious Harry Bickerstaff;
but William Bickerstaff, the most prudent man of
our family, shall be my executor.</p>

From <em>Thursday, Aug. 3</em>, to <em>Saturday, Aug. 5, 1710</em>.</h2>


<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Aug. 4.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Having yesterday morning received a paper of Latin
verses, written with much elegance in honour of
these my papers, and being informed at the same time
that they were composed by a youth under age, I read
them with much delight, as an instance of his improvement.
There is not a greater pleasure to old age, than
seeing young people entertain themselves in such a manner
as that we can partake of their enjoyments. On such
occasions we flatter ourselves that we are not quite laid
aside in the world, but that we are either used with gratitude
for what we were, or honoured for what we are. A
well-inclined young man, and whose good-breeding is
founded upon the principles of nature and virtue, must
needs take delight in being agreeable to his elders, as we
are truly delighted when we are not the jest of them.
When I say this, I must confess I cannot but think it a
very lamentable thing that there should be a necessity
for making that a rule of life, which should be, methinks,
a mere instinct of nature. If reflection upon a man in
poverty, whom we once knew in riches, is an argument
of commiseration with generous minds; sure old age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
which is a decay from that vigour which the young possess,
and must certainly (if not prevented against their
will) arrive at, should be more forcibly the object of that
reverence which honest spirits are inclined to from a
sense of being themselves liable to what they observe has
already overtaken others.</p>

<p>My three nephews, whom in June last was twelvemonth
I disposed of according to their several capacities
and inclinations, the first to the University, the second to
a merchant, and the third to a woman of quality as her
page, by my invitation dined with me to-day. It is my
custom often, when I have a mind to give myself a more
than ordinary cheerfulness, to invite a certain young
gentlewoman of our neighbourhood to make one of the
company. She did me that favour this day. The presence
of a beautiful woman of honour, to minds which
are not trivially disposed, displays an alacrity which is
not to be communicated by any other object. It was
not unpleasant to me to look into her thoughts of the
company she was in. She smiled at the party of pleasure
I had thought of for her, which was composed of an old
man and three boys. My scholar, my citizen, and myself
were very soon neglected; and the young courtier, by the
bow he made to her at her entrance, engaged her observation
without a rival. I observed the Oxonian not a little
discomposed at this preference, while the trader kept his
eye upon his uncle. My nephew Will had a thousand
secret resolutions to break in upon the discourse of his
younger brother, who gave my fair companion a full
account of the fashion, and what was reckoned most
becoming to this complexion, and what sort of habit
appeared best upon the other shape. He proceeded to
acquaint her, who of quality was well or sick within the
bills of mortality, and named very familiarly all his lady's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
acquaintance, not forgetting her very words when he
spoke of their characters. Besides all this, he had a road
of flattery; and upon her inquiring what sort of woman
Lady Lovely was in her person, "Really, madam," says
the jackanapes, "she is exactly of your height and shape;
but as you are fair, she is a brown woman." There was
no enduring that this fop should outshine us all at this
unmerciful rate, therefore I thought fit to talk to my
young scholar concerning his studies; and because I would
throw his learning into present service, I desired him to
repeat to me the translation he had made of some tender
verses in Theocritus. He did so, with an air of elegance
peculiar to the college to which I sent him. I made some
exceptions to the turn of the phrases, which he defended
with much modesty, as believing in that place the matter
was rather to consult the softness of a swain's passion,
than the strength of his expressions. It soon appeared
that Will had outstripped his brother in the opinion of
our young lady. A little poetry to one who is bred
a scholar has the same effect that a good carriage of his
person has on one who is to live in courts. The favour
of women is so natural a passion, that I envied both the
boys their success in the approbation of my guest; and
I thought the only person invulnerable was my young
trader. During the whole meal, I could observe in the
children a mutual contempt and scorn of each other,
arising from their different way of life and education,
and took that occasion to advertise them of such growing
distastes, which might mislead them in their future life,
and disappoint their friends, as well as themselves, of the
advantages which might be expected from the diversity
of their professions and interests.</p>

<p>The prejudices which are growing up between these
brothers from the different ways of education, are what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
create the most fatal misunderstandings in life. But all
distinctions of disparagement merely from our circumstances,
are such as will not bear the examination of
reason. The courtier, the trader, and the scholar should
all have an equal pretension to the denomination of a
gentleman. That tradesman who deals with me in a
commodity which I do not understand with uprightness,
has much more right to that character, than the courtier
who gives me false hopes, or the scholar who laughs at
my ignorance.</p>

<p>The appellation of gentleman is never to be affixed to
a man's circumstances, but to his behaviour in them.
For this reason I shall ever, as far as I am able, give my
nephews such impressions as shall make them value themselves
rather as they are useful to others, than as they
are conscious of merit in themselves. There are no
qualities from which we ought to pretend to the esteem
of others, but such as render us serviceable to them; for
free men have no superiors but benefactors. I was going
on like a true old fellow to this purpose to my guests,
when I received the following epistle:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I have yours,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> with notice of a benefit ticket of &pound;400
per annum, both enclosed by Mr. Elliot, who had
my numbers for that purpose. Your philosophic advice
came very seasonably to me with that good fortune; but
I must be so sincere with you as to acknowledge, I owe
my present moderation more to my own folly than your
wisdom. You will think this strange till I inform you,
that I had fixed my thoughts upon the &pound;1000 a year,
and had with that expectation laid down so many agree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>able
plans for my behaviour towards my new lovers and
old friends, that I have received this favour of fortune
with an air of disappointment. This is interpreted by
all who know not the springs of my heart as a wonderful
piece of humility. I hope my present state of mind will
grow into that; but I confess my conduct to be now
owing to another cause. However, I know you will
approve my taking hold even of imperfections to find
my way towards virtue, which is so feeble in us at the
best, that we are often beholden to our faults for the
first appearances of it. I am,</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment Aug. 7.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">An old acquaintance who met me this morning seemed
overjoyed to see me, and told me, I looked as well
as he had known me do these forty years: but, continued
he, "not quite the man you were when we visited together
at Lady Brightly's. Oh, Isaac! those days are over.
Do you think there are any such fine creatures now living
as we then conversed with?" He went on with a thousand
incoherent circumstances, which, in his imagination,
must needs please me; but they had the quite contrary
effect. The flattery with which he began, in telling me
how well I wore, was not disagreeable; but his indiscreet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
mention of a set of acquaintances we had outlived, recalled
ten thousand things to my memory, which made me
reflect upon my present condition with regret. Had he
indeed been so kind as, after a long absence, to felicitate
me upon an indolent and easy old age, and mentioned
how much he and I had to thank for, who at our time
of day could walk firmly, eat heartily, and converse
cheerfully, he had kept up my pleasure in myself. But
of all mankind there are none so shocking as these injudicious
civil people. They ordinarily begin upon something
that they know must be a satisfaction; but then,
for fear of the imputation of flattery, they follow it
with the last thing in the world of which you would be
reminded. It is this that perplexes civil persons. The
reason that there is such a general outcry amongst us
against flatterers, is, that there are so very few good ones.
It is the nicest art in this life, and is a part of eloquence
which does not want the preparation that is necessary to
all other parts of it, that your audience should be your
well-wishers: for praise from an enemy is the most
pleasing of all commendations.</p>

<p>It is generally to be observed, that the person most
agreeable to a man for a constancy is he that has no
shining qualities, but is a certain degree above great
imperfections, whom he can live with as his inferior, and
who will either overlook or not observe his little defects.
Such an easy companion as this, either now and then
throws out a little flattery, or lets a man silently flatter
himself in his superiority to him. If you take notice,
there is hardly a rich man in the world who has not such
a led friend<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of small consideration, who is a darling for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>his insignificancy. It is a great ease to have one in our
own shape a species below us, and who, without being
listed in our service, is by nature of our retinue. These
dependants are of excellent use on a rainy day, or when
a man has not a mind to dress or to exclude solitude,
when one has neither a mind to that or to company.
There are of this good-natured order who are so kind as
to divide themselves, and do these good offices to many.
Five or six of them visit a whole quarter of the town,
and exclude the spleen without fees from the families
they frequent. If they do not prescribe physic, they can
be company when you take it. Very great benefactors
to the rich, or those whom they call people at their ease,
are your persons of no consequence. I have known some
of them, by the help of a little cunning, make delicious
flatterers. They know the course of the town and the
general characters of persons: by this means they will
sometimes tell the most agreeable falsehoods imaginable.
They will acquaint you, that such a one of a quite contrary
party said, that though you were engaged in different
interests, yet he had the greatest respect for your good
sense and address. When one of these has a little cunning,
he passes his time in the utmost satisfaction to
himself and his friends: for his position is never to report
or speak a displeasing thing to his friend. As for letting
him go on in an error, he knows advice against them is
the office of persons of greater talents and less discretion.</p>

<p>The Latin word for a flatterer (<em>assentator</em>) implies no
more than a person that barely consents; and indeed
such a one, if a man were able to purchase or maintain
him, cannot be bought too dear. Such a one never contradicts
you, but gains upon you, not by a fulsome way
of commending you in broad terms, but liking whatever
you propose or utter; at the same time is ready to beg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
your pardon, and gainsay you, if you chance to speak ill
of yourself. An old lady is very seldom without such a
companion as this, who can recite the names of all her
lovers, and the matches refused by her in the days when
she minded such vanities (as she is pleased to call them,
though she so much approves the mention of them). It
is to be noted, that a woman's flatterer is generally older
than herself, her years serving at once to recommend her
patroness's age, and to add weight to her complaisance in
all other particulars.</p>

<p>We gentlemen of small fortunes are extremely necessitous
in this particular. I have indeed one who smokes
with me often; but his parts are so low, that all the
incense he does me is to fill his pipe with me, and to be
out at just as many whiffs as I take. This is all the
praise or assent that he is capable of, yet there are more
hours when I would rather be in his company than that
of the brightest man I know. It would be a hard matter
to give an account of this inclination to be flattered; but
if we go to the bottom of it, we shall find that the pleasure
in it is something like that of receiving money which
lay out. Every man thinks he has an estate of reputation,
and is glad to see one that will bring any of it home
to him: it is no matter how dirty a bag it is conveyed to
him in, or by how clownish a messenger, so the money is
good. All that we want to be pleased with flattery, is to
believe that the man is sincere who gives it us. It is by
this one accident that absurd creatures often outrun the
more skilful in this art. Their want of ability is here an
advantage, and their bluntness, as it is the seeming effect
of sincerity, is the best cover to artifice.</p>

<p>Terence introduces a flatterer talking to a coxcomb
whom he cheats out of a livelihood, and a third person
on the stage makes on him this pleasant remark, "This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
fellow has an art of making fools madmen."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The love
of flattery is indeed sometimes the weakness of a great
mind; but you see it also in persons who otherwise discover
no manner of relish of anything above mere sensuality.
These latter it sometimes improves, but always
debases the former. A fool is in himself the object of
pity till he is flattered. By the force of that his stupidity
is raised into affectation, and he becomes of dignity enough
to be ridiculous. I remember a droll, that upon one's
saying, "The times are so ticklish that there must great
care be taken what one says in conversation," answered
with an air of surliness and honesty, "If people will be
free, let them be so in the manner that I am, who never
abuse a man but to his face." He had no reputation for
saying dangerous truths; therefore when it was repeated,
"You abuse a man but to his face?" "Yes," says he,
"I flatter him."</p>

<p>It is indeed the greatest of injuries to flatter any but
the unhappy, or such as are displeased with themselves
for some infirmity. In this latter case we have a member
of our club, that when Sir Jeffery falls asleep, wakens him
with snoring. This makes Sir Jeffery hold up for some
moments the longer, to see there are men younger than
himself among us who are more lethargic than he is.</p>

<p>When flattery is practised upon any other consideration,
it is the most abject thing in nature; nay, I cannot
think of any character below the flatterer, except he that
envies him. You meet with fellows prepared to be as
mean as possible in their condescensions and expressions;
but they want persons and talents to rise up to such a
baseness. As a coxcomb is a fool of parts, so is a flatterer
a knave of parts.</p>

<p>The best of this order that I know, is one who dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>guises
it under a spirit of contradiction or reproof. He
told an errant driveller the other day, that he did not care
for being in company with him, because he heard he
turned his absent friends into ridicule. And upon Lady
Autumn's<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> disputing with him about something that happened
at the Revolution, he replied with a very angry
tone, "Pray, madam, give me leave to know more of a

From <em>Tuesday, Aug. 8</em>, to <em>Thursday, Aug. 10, 1710</em>.</h2>


<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Aug. 9.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">A noble painter, who has an ambition to draw a
history-piece, has desired of me to give him a subject
on which he may show the utmost force of his art
and genius. For this purpose I have pitched upon that
remarkable incident between Alexander the Great and his
physician. This Prince, in the midst of his conquests in
Persia, was seized by a violent fever; and according to
the account we have of his vast mind, his thoughts were
more employed about his recovery as it regarded the war,
than as it concerned his own life. He professed, a slow
method was worse than death to him, because it was what
he more dreaded, an interruption of his glory. He desired
a dangerous, so it might be a speedy remedy.
During this impatience of the King, it is well known that
Darius had offered an immense sum to any who should
take away his life. But Philippus, the most esteemed
and most knowing of his physicians, promised, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
within three days' time he would prepare a medicine for
him which should restore him more expeditiously than
could be imagined. Immediately after this engagement,
Alexander receives a letter from the most considerable
of his captains, with intelligence, that Darius had bribed
Philippus to poison him. Every circumstance imaginable
favoured this suspicion; but this monarch, who did
nothing but in an extraordinary manner, concealed the
letter; and while the medicine was preparing, spent all
his thoughts upon his behaviour in this important
incident. From his long soliloquy he came to this
resolution: "Alexander must not lie here alive to be
oppressed by his enemy. I will not believe my physician
guilty; or, I will perish rather by his guilt than my own
diffidence."</p>

<p>At the appointed hour, Philippus enters with the
potion. One cannot but form to one's self on occasion
the encounter of their eyes, the resolution in those of
the patient, and the benevolence in the countenance
of the physician. The hero raised himself in his bed,
and holding the letter in one hand, and the potion in
the other, drank the medicine. It will exercise my
friend's pencil and brain to place this action in its
proper beauty. A prince observing the features of a
suspected traitor after having drank the poison he
offered him, is a circumstance so full of passion, that
it will require the highest strength of his imagination
to conceive it, much more to express it. But as
painting is eloquence and poetry in mechanism, I shall
raise his ideas, by reading with him the finest draughts
of the passions concerned in this circumstance from the
most excellent poets and orators. The confidence which
Alexander assumes from the air of Philippus's face as
he is reading his accusation, and the generous disdain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
which is to rise in the features of a falsely accused man,
are principally to be regarded. In this particular he
must heighten his thoughts, by reflecting, that he is
not drawing only an innocent man traduced, but a man
zealously affected to his person and safety, full of resentment
for being thought false. How shall we contrive
to express the highest admiration mingled with disdain?
How shall we in strokes of a pencil say what Philippus
did to his Prince on this occasion? "Sir, my life never
depended on yours more than it does now. Without
knowing this secret, I prepared the potion, which you
have taken as what concerned Philippus no less than
Alexander; and there is nothing new in this adventure,
but that it makes me still more admire the generosity
and confidence of my master." Alexander took him by
the hand, and said, "Philippus, I am confident you had
rather I had any other way to have manifested the faith
I have in you, than a case which so nearly concerns me:
and in gratitude I now assure you, I am anxious for the
effect of your medicine, more for your sake than my
own."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>My painter is employed by a man of sense and
wealth to furnish him a gallery, and I shall join with
my friend in the designing part. It is the great use
of pictures to raise in our minds either agreeable ideas
of our absent friends, or high images of eminent personages.
But the latter design is, methinks, carried
on in a very improper way; for to fill a room full of
battle-pieces, pompous histories of sieges, and a tall
hero alone in a crowd of insignificant figures about him,
is of no consequence to private men. But to place
before our eyes great and illustrious men in those parts
and circumstances of life wherein their behaviour may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
have an effect upon our minds, as being such as we
partake with them merely as they were men: such as
these, I say, may be just and useful ornaments of an
elegant apartment. In this collection therefore that
we are making, we will not have the battles, but the
sentiments of Alexander. The affair we were just
now talking of, has circumstances of the highest nature,
and yet their grandeur has little to do with his fortune.
If by observing such a piece as that of his taking a bowl
of poison with so much magnanimity, a man, the next
time he has a fit of the spleen, is less froward to his
friend or his servants; thus far is some improvement.</p>

<p>I have frequently thought, that if we had many
draughts which were historical of certain passions, and
had the true figure of the great men we see transported
by them, it would be of the most solid advantage
imaginable. To consider this mighty man on one
occasion administer to the wants of a poor soldier,
benumbed with cold, with the greatest humanity; at
another, barbarously stabbing a faithful officer: at one
time, so generously chaste and virtuous as to give his
captive Statira her liberty; at another, burning a town
at the instigation of Thais&mdash;this sort of changes in the
same person are what would be more beneficial lessons
of morality than the several revolutions in a great
man's fortune. There are but one or two in an age
to whom the pompous incidents of his life can be
exemplary; but I or any man may be as sick, as good-natured,
as compassionate, and as angry as Alexander
the Great. My purpose in all this chat is, that so
excellent a furniture may not for the future have so
romantic a turn, but allude to incidents which come
within the fortunes of the ordinary race of men. I do
not know but it is by the force of this senseless custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
that people are drawn in postures they would not for
half they are worth be surprised in. The unparalleled
fierceness of some rural squires drawn in red, or in
armour, who never dreamed to destroy anything above
a fox, is a common and ordinary offence of this kind.
But I shall give an account of our whole gallery on
another occasion.</p>

From <em>Thursday, Aug. 10</em>, to <em>Saturday, Aug. 12, 1710</em>.</h2>


<h3><em>Sheer Lane, Aug. 10.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I did myself the honour this day to make a visit to a
lady of quality, who is one of those who are ever
railing at the vices of the age, but mean only one vice,
because it is the only vice they are not guilty of. She
went so far as to fall foul on a young woman who has
had imputations; but whether they were just or not, no
one knows but herself. However that is, she is in her
present behaviour modest, humble, pious, and discreet.
I thought it became me to bring this censorious lady
to reason, and let her see she was a much more vicious
woman than the person she spoke of.</p>

<p>"Madam," said I, "you are very severe to this poor
young woman, for a trespass which I believe Heaven has
forgiven her, and for which you see she is for ever out
of countenance." "Nay, Mr. Bickerstaff," she interrupted,
"if you at this time of day contradict people
of virtue, and stand up for ill women&mdash;" "No, no,
madam," said I, "not so fast; she is reclaimed, and I
fear you never will be. Nay, nay, madam, do not be
in a passion, but let me tell you what you are. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
are indeed as good as your neighbours, but that is being
very bad. You are a woman at the head of a family,
and lead a perfect town lady's life. You go on your
own way, and consult nothing but your glass. What
imperfections indeed you see there, you immediately
mend as fast as you can. You may do the same by the
faults I tell you of, for they are much more in your
power to correct.</p>

<p>"You are to know, then, that you visiting ladies, that
carry your virtue from house to house with so much
prattle in each other's applause, and triumph over other
people's faults, I grant you have but the speculation of
vice in your own conversations, but promote the practice
of it in all others you have to do with.</p>

<p>"As for you, madam, your time passes away in dressing,
eating, sleeping, and praying. When you rise in a morning,
I grant you an hour spent very well; but you come
out to dress in so froward a humour, that the poor girl
who attends you, curses her very being in that she is your
servant, for the peevish things you say to her; when
this poor creature is put into a way, that good or evil
are regarded but as they relieve her from the hours she
has and must pass with you. The next you have to do
with is your coachman and footmen. They convey your
ladyship to church. While you are praying there, they
are cursing, swearing, and drinking in an alehouse.
During the time also which your ladyship sets apart for
heaven, you are to know, that your cook is swearing and
fretting in preparation for your dinner. Soon after your
meal you make visits, and the whole world that belongs
to you speaks all the ill of you which you are repeating
of others. You see, madam, whatever way you go, all
about you are in a very broad one. The morality of
these people it is your proper business to inquire into;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and till you reform them, you had best let your equals
alone; otherwise, if I allow you you are not vicious, you
must allow me you are not virtuous."</p>

<p>I took my leave, and received at my coming home the
following letter:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I have lived a pure and undefiled virgin these twenty-seven
years; and I assure you, 'tis with great grief
and sorrow of heart I tell you, that I become weary and
impatient of the derision of the gigglers of our sex, who
call me old maid, and tell me I shall lead apes.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> If you
are truly a patron of the distressed, and an adept in
astrology, you will advise whether I shall or ought to be
prevailed upon by the impertinencies of my own sex, to
give way to the importunities of yours. I assure you, I
am surrounded with both, though at present a forlorn.</p>

<p class="right">"I am, &amp;c."</p>

<p>I must defer my answer to this lady out of a point of
chronology. She says, she has been twenty-seven years
a maid; but I fear, according to a common error, she
dates her virginity from her birth, which is a very
erroneous method; for a woman of twenty is no more
to be thought chaste so many years, than a man of that
age can be said to have been so long valiant. We must
not allow people the favour of a virtue till they have
been under the temptation to the contrary. A woman is
not a maid till her birthday, as we call it, of her fifteenth
year. My plaintiff is therefore desired to inform me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
whether she is at present in her twenty-eighth or forty-third
year, and she shall be despatched accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>


<h3><em>St. James's Coffee-house, Aug. 11.</em><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">A merchant came hither this morning, and read a letter
from a correspondent of his at Milan. It was
dated of the 7th instant, N.S. The following is an
abstract of it: On the 25th of the last month, five
thousand men were on their march in the Lampourdan,
under the command of General Wesell, having received
orders from his Catholic Majesty to join him in his camp
with all possible expedition. The Duke of Anjou soon
had intelligence of their motion, and took a resolution to
decamp, in order to intercept them, within a day's march
of our army. The King of Spain was apprehensive the
enemy might make such a movement, and commanded
General Stanhope<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> with a body of horse, consisting of
fourteen squadrons, to observe their course, and prevent
their passage over the rivers Segre and Noguera between
Lerida and Balaguer. It happened to be the first day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>that officer had appeared abroad after a dangerous and
violent fever; but he received the King's commands on
this occasion with a joy which surmounted his present
weakness, and on the 27th of last month came up with
the enemy on the plains of Balaguer. The Duke of
Anjou's rear-guard consisting of twenty-six squadrons,
that general sent intelligence of their posture to the
King, and desired his Majesty's orders to attack them.
During the time which he waited for his instructions, he
made his disposition for the charge, which was to divide
themselves into three bodies; one to be commanded by
himself in the centre, a body on the right by Count
Maurice of Nassau, and the third on the left by the Earl
of Rochford.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Upon the receipt of his Majesty's direction
to attack the enemy, the general himself charged
with the utmost vigour and resolution, while the Earl of
Rochford and Count Maurice extended themselves on
his right and left, to prevent the advantage the enemy
might make of the superiority of their numbers. What
appears to have misled the enemy's general in this affair
was, that it was not supposed practicable that the confederates
would attack him till they had received a
reinforcement. For this reason he pursued his march
without facing about, till we were actually coming on
to engagement. General Stanhope's disposition made it
impracticable to do it at that time, Count Maurice and
the Earl of Rochford attacking them in the instant in
which they were forming themselves. The charge was
made with the greatest gallantry, and the enemy very
soon put into so great disorder, that their whole cavalry
were commanded to support their rear-guard. Upon
the advance of this reinforcement, all the horse of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>King of Spain were come up to sustain General Stanhope,
insomuch that the battle improved to a general engagement
of the cavalry of both armies. After a warm
dispute for some time, it ended in the utter defeat of all
the Duke of Anjou's horse. Upon the despatch of these
advices, that Prince was retiring towards Lerida. We
have no account of any considerable loss on our side,
except that both those heroic youths, the Earl of Rochford
and Count Nassau, fell in this action. They were,
you know, both sons of persons who had a great place in
the confidence of your late King William; and I doubt
not but their deaths will endear their families, which
were ennobled by him, in your nation. General Stanhope
has been reported by the enemy dead of his wounds;
but he received only a slight contusion on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"<em>P.S.</em>&mdash;We acknowledge you here a mighty brave
people; but you are said to love quarrelling so well,
that you cannot be quiet at home. The favourers of
the House of Bourbon among us affirm, that this Stanhope,
who could as it were get out of his sick-bed to
fight against their King of Spain, must be of the anti-monarchical
party."</p>

<p class="drop-cap">If there were no other consequence of it, but barely
that human creatures on this day assemble themselves
before their Creator, without regard to their usual em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>ployments,
their minds at leisure from the cares of this
life, and their bodies adorned with the best attire they
can bestow on them; I say, were this mere outward
celebration of a Sabbath all that is expected from men,
even that were a laudable distinction, and a purpose
worthy the human nature. But when there is added to
it the sublime pleasure of devotion, our being is exalted
above itself; and he who spends a seventh day in the
contemplation of the next life, will not easily fall into
the corruptions of this in the other six. They who
never admit thoughts of this kind into their imagination,
lose higher and sweeter satisfactions than can be
raised by any other entertainment. The most illiterate
man who is touched with devotion, and uses frequent
exercises of it, contracts a certain greatness of mind,
mingled with a noble simplicity, that raises him above
those of the same condition; and there is an indelible
mark of goodness in those who sincerely possess it. It
is hardly possible it should be otherwise; for the fervours
of a pious mind will naturally contract such an earnestness
and attention towards a better being, as will make
the ordinary passages of life go off with a becoming
indifference. By this, a man in the lowest condition
will not appear mean, or in the most splendid fortune,
insolent.</p>

<p>As to all the intricacies and vicissitudes under which
men are ordinarily entangled with the utmost sorrow and
passion, one who is devoted to Heaven when he falls
into such difficulties is led by a clue through a labyrinth.
As to this world, he does not pretend to skill in the
mazes of it, but fixes his thoughts upon one certainty,
that he shall soon be out of it. And we may ask very
boldly, What can be a more sure consolation than to
have a hope in death? When men are arrived at think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>ing
of their very dissolution with pleasure, how few
things are there that can be terrible to them? Certainly
nothing can be dreadful to such spirits, but what would
make death terrible to them, falsehood towards man,
or impiety towards Heaven. To such as these, as there
are certainly many such, the gratifications of innocent
pleasures are doubled, even with reflections upon their
imperfection. The disappointments which naturally
attend the great promises we make ourselves in expected
enjoyments, strike no damp upon such men, but only
quicken their hopes of soon knowing joys, which are too
pure to admit of allay or satiety.</p>

<p>It is thought among the politer part of mankind an
imperfection to want a relish of any of those things
which refine our lives. This is the foundation of the
acceptance which eloquence, music, and poetry make in
the world; and I know not why devotion, considered
merely as an exaltation of our happiness, should not
at least be so far regarded as to be considered. It is
possible the very inquiry would lead men into such
thoughts and gratifications as they did not expect to
meet with in this place. Many a good acquaintance has
been lost from a general prepossession in his disfavour,
and a severe aspect has often hid under it a very agreeable
companion.</p>

<p>There are no distinguishing qualities among men to
which there are not false pretenders; but though none
is more pretended to than that of devotion, there are,
perhaps, fewer successful impostors in this kind than any
other. There is something so natively great and good
in a person that is truly devout, that an awkward man
may as well pretend to be genteel, as a hypocrite to be
pious. The constraint in words and actions are equally
visible in both cases, and anything set up in their room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
does but remove the endeavourers the further off their
pretensions. But however the sense of true piety is
abated, there is no other motive of action that can carry
us through all the vicissitudes of life with alacrity and
resolution. But piety, like philosophy, when it is superficial,
does but make men appear the worse for it; and
a principle that is but half received, does but distract,
instead of guiding our behaviour. When I reflect upon
the unequal conduct of Lotius, I see many things that
run directly counter to his interest; therefore I cannot
attribute his labours for the public good to ambition.
When I consider his disregard to his fortune, I cannot
esteem him covetous. How then can I reconcile his
neglect of himself, and his zeal for others? I have long
suspected him to be a little pious: but no man ever hid
his vice with greater caution than he does his virtue. It
was the praise of a great Roman, that he had rather be,
than appear good. But such is the weakness of Lotius,
that I dare say, he had rather be esteemed irreligious
than devout. By I know not what impatience of raillery
he is wonderfully fearful of being thought too great a
believer. A hundred little devices are made use of to
hide a time of private devotion; and he will allow you
any suspicion of his being ill employed, so you do not
tax him with being well. But alas! how mean is such a
behaviour? To boast of virtue is a most ridiculous way
of disappointing the merit of it, but not so pitiful as
that of being ashamed of it. How unhappy is the
wretch who makes the most absolute and independent
motive of action the cause of perplexity and inconstancy?
How much another figure does C&aelig;licola<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> make with all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>who know him? His great and superior mind, frequently
exalted by the raptures of heavenly meditation,
is to all his friends of the same use as if an angel were to
appear at the decision of their disputes. They very well
understand he is as much disinterested and unbiassed as
such a being. He considers all applications made to
him, as those addresses will effect his own application
to heaven. All his determinations are delivered with a
beautiful humility; and he pronounces his decisions with
the air of one who is more frequently a supplicant than a
judge.</p>

<p>Thus humble, and thus great, is the man who is moved
by piety, and exalted by devotion. But behold this recommended
by the masterly hand of a great divine<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> I
have heretofore made bold with:</p>

<p>"It is such a pleasure as can never cloy or overwork
the mind; a delight that grows and improves under
thought and reflection; and while it exercises, does also
endear itself to the mind. All pleasures that affect the
body must needs weary, because they transport; and all
transportation is a violence; and no violence can be lasting,
but determines upon the falling of the spirits, which
are not able to keep up that height of motion that the
pleasure of the senses raises them to. And therefore
how inevitably does an immoderate laughter end in a
sigh, which is only nature's recovering itself after a force
done to it; but the religious pleasure of a well-disposed
mind moves gently, and therefore constantly. It does
not effect by rapture and ecstasy, but is like the pleasure
of health, greater and stronger than those that call up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the senses with grosser and more affecting impressions.
No man's body is as strong as his appetites; but Heaven
has corrected the boundlessness of his voluptuous desires
by stinting his strengths, and contracting his capacities....
The pleasure of the religious man is an easy and
a portable pleasure, such a one as he carries about in his
bosom, without alarming either the eye or envy of the
world. A man putting all his pleasure into this one, is
like a traveller putting all his goods into one jewel; the
value is the same, and the convenience greater."</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I have had much importunity to answer the following
letter:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Reading over a volume of yours, I find the words
<i lang="la">simplex munditiis</i> mentioned as a description of
a very well-dressed woman.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> I beg of you, for the sake
of the sex, to explain these terms. I cannot comprehend

own name, which is,</p>

<p>

<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"Your humble Servant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">"<span class="smcap">Plain English</span>."</span><br />
</p>

<p>I think the lady's brother has given us a very good
idea of that elegant expression, it being the greatest
beauty of speech to be close and intelligible. To this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
end nothing is to be more carefully consulted than plainness.
In a lady's attire this is the single excellence; for
to be what some call fine, is the same vice in that case as
to be florid is in writing or speaking. I have studied
and written on this important subject till I almost despair
of making a reformation in the females of this island,
where we have more beauty than in any spot in the
universe, if we did not disguise it by false garniture, and
detract from it by impertinent improvements. I have by
me a treatise concerning pinners, which I have some hopes
will contribute to the amendment of the present head-dresses,
to which I have solid and unanswerable objections.
But most of the errors in that and other particulars of
adorning the head, are crept into the world from the
ignorance of modern tirewomen; for it is come to that
pass, that an awkward creature in the first year of her
apprenticeship, that can hardly stick a pin, shall take
upon her to dress a woman of the first quality. However,
it is certain that there requires in a good tirewoman
a perfect skill in optics; for all the force of ornament is
to contribute to the intention of the eyes. Thus she
who has a mind to look killing, must arm her face accordingly,
and not leave her eyes and cheeks undressed.
There is Araminta so sensible of this, that she never will
see even her own husband without a hood<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> on. Can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>any one living bear to see Miss Gruel, lean as she is,
with her hair tied back after the modern way? But
such is the folly of our ladies, that because one who is
a beauty, out of ostentation of her being such, takes
care to wear something that she knows cannot be of any
consequence to her complexion; I say, our women run
on so heedlessly in the fashion, that though it is the
interest of some to hide as much of their faces as possible,
yet because a leading toast appeared with a backward
head-dress, the rest shall follow the mode, without
observing that the author of the fashion assumed it
because it could become no one but herself.</p>

<p>Flavia<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> is ever well dressed, and always the genteelest
woman you meet: but the make of her mind very much
contributes to the ornament of her body. She has the
greatest simplicity of manners of any of her sex. This
makes everything look native about her, and her clothes
are so exactly fitted, that they appear as it were part of
her person. Every one that sees her, knows her to be of
quality; but her distinction is owing to her manner, and
not to her habit. Her beauty is full of attraction, but
not of allurement. There is such a composure in her
looks, and propriety in her dress, that you would think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>it impossible she should change the garb you one day
see her in for anything so becoming, till you next day
see her in another. There is no other mystery in this,
but that however she is apparelled, she is herself the
same: for there is so immediate a relation between our
thoughts and gestures, that a woman must think well to
look well.</p>

<p>But this weighty subject I must put off for some
other matters in which my correspondents are urgent for
answers, which I shall do where I can, and appeal to the
judgment of others where I cannot.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Taking the air the other day on horseback in the
Green Lane that leads to Southgate, I discovered
coming towards me a person well mounted in a mask;
and I accordingly expected, as any one would, to have
been robbed. But when we came up with each other,
the spark, to my greater surprise, very peaceably gave me
the way; which made me take courage enough to ask
him, if he masqueraded, or how? He made me no
answer, but still continued <em>incognito</em>. This was certainly
an ass in a lion's skin; a harmless bull-beggar,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> who delights

London, and get him apprehended, on suspicion of being
a highwayman: but when I reflected, that it was the
proper office of the magistrate to punish only knaves,

whose lady, the Duchess of Grafton, wears a great high head-dress,
such as was in fashion fifteen years ago, and looks like a mad woman

Mrs. Anne Oldfield (see No. 10), of whom Cibber wrote: "Had

in reality what in the character of Lady Betty Modish she only excellently
acted, an agreeable gay woman of quality, a little too conscious
of her natural attractions. I have often seen her in private
societies, where women of the first rank might have borrowed some
part of their behaviour, without the least diminution of their sense of
dignity." From this passage it will be seen that the account of a lady
"of quality," with "the greatest simplicity of manners," can hardly be
a description of Mrs. Oldfield. Moreover, the name "Flavia" occurs
in No. 239, by Addison, and it appears that the lady there referred to
was Miss Osborne, who became Atterbury's wife.</p></div>

From <em>Thursday, Aug. 17</em>, to <em>Saturday, Aug. 19, 1710</em>.</h2>


<h3><em>Sheer Lane, Aug. 16.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There has of late crept in among the downright English
a mighty spirit of dissimulation. But before
we discourse of this vice, it will be necessary to observe,
that the learned make a difference between simulation
and dissimulation.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Simulation is a pretence of what is
not, and dissimulation a concealment of what is. The
latter is our present affair. When you look round you
in public places in this island, you see the generality of
mankind carry in their countenance an air of challenge
or defiance: and there is no such man to be found among
us who naturally strives to do greater honours and civilities
than he receives. This innate sullenness or stubbornness
of complexion is hardly to be conquered by any of
our islanders. For which reason, however they may
pretend to choose one another, they make but very
awkward rogues; and their dislike to each other is seldom
so well dissembled, but it is suspected. When once it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>so, it had as good be professed. A man who dissembles
well must have none of what we call stomach, otherwise
he will be cold in his professions of good-will where he
hates; an imperfection of the last ill consequence in
business. This fierceness in our natures is apparent from
the conduct of our young fellows, who are not got into
the schemes and arts of life which the children of this
world walk by. One would think that, of course, when
a man of any consequence for his figure, his mien, or his
gravity, passes by a youth, he should certainly have the
first advances of salutation; but he is, you may observe,
treated in a quite different manner, it being the very
characteristic of an English temper to defy. As I am
an Englishman, I find it a very hard matter to bring
myself to pull off the hat first; but it is the only way to
be upon any good terms with those we meet with: therefore
the first advance is of high moment. Men judge
of others by themselves; and he that will command with
us must condescend. It moves one's spleen very agreeably
to see fellows pretend to be dissemblers without
this lesson. They are so reservedly complaisant till they
have learned to resign their natural passions, that all the
steps they make towards gaining those whom they would
be well with, are but so many marks of what they really
are, and not of what they would appear.</p>

<p>The rough Britons, when they pretend to be artful
towards one another, are ridiculous enough; but when
they set up for vices they have not, and dissemble their
good with an affectation of ill, they are insupportable.
I know two men in this town who make as good figures
as any in it, that manage their credit so well as to be
thought atheists, and yet say their prayers morning and
evening. Tom Springly the other day pretended to go
to an assignation with a married woman at Rosamond's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Pond,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and was seen soon after reading the responses
with great gravity at six-of-clock prayers.</p>


<h3><em>Sheer Lane, Aug. 17.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Though the following epistle bears a just accusation

piece of justice to another, I insert it at large:</p>

<p>
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,<br />

<p class="drop-cap">"I have lately read your paper<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> wherein you represent
a conversation between a young lady, your three
nephews, and yourself; and am not a little offended at
the figure you give your young merchant in the presence
of a beauty. The topic of love is a subject on which a
man is more beholden to nature for his eloquence, than
to the instruction of the schools, or my lady's woman.
From the two latter, your scholar and page must have
reaped all their advantage above him. I know by this
time you have pronounced me a trader. I acknowledge
it, but cannot bear the exclusion from any pretence of
speaking agreeably to a fine woman, or from any degree
of generosity that way. You have among us citizens
many well-wishers, but it is for the justice of your representations,
which we, perhaps, are better judges of than
you (by the account you give of your nephew) seem to
allow.</p>

<p>"To give you an opportunity of making us some
reparation, I desire you would tell your own way the
following instance of heroic love in the city. You are
to remember, that somewhere in your writings, for enlarging
the territories of virtue and honour, you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>multiplied the opportunities of attaining to heroic virtue,
and have hinted, that in whatever state of life a man is,
if he does things above what is ordinarily performed by
men of his rank, he is in those instances a hero.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>"Tom Trueman, a young gentleman of eighteen years
of age, fell passionately in love with the beauteous Almira,
daughter to his master. Her regard for him was no less
tender. Trueman was better acquainted with his master's
affairs than his daughter, and secretly lamented that each
day brought him by many miscarriages nearer bankruptcy
than the former. This unhappy posture of their affairs
the youth suspected was owing to the ill management of
a factor, in whom his master had an entire confidence.
Trueman took a proper occasion, when his master was
ruminating on his decaying fortune, to address him for
leave to spend the remainder of his time with his foreign
correspondent. During three years' stay in that employment
he became acquainted with all that concerned his
master; and by his great address in the management of
that knowledge, saved him ten thousand pounds. Soon
after this accident, Trueman's uncle left him a considerable
estate. Upon receiving that advice, he returned to
England, and demanded Almira of her father. The
father, overjoyed at the match, offered him the &pound;10,000
he had saved him, with the further proposal of resigning
to him all his business. Trueman refused both, and
retired into the country with his bride, contented with
his own fortune, though perfectly skilled in all the
methods of improving it.</p>

<p>"It is to be noted, that Trueman refused twenty
thousand pounds with another young lady; so that
reckoning both his self-denials, he is to have in your
court the merit of having given &pound;30,000 for the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
he loved. This gentleman I claim your justice to; and
hope you will be convinced, that some of us have larger
views than only cash debtor, <i lang="la">per contra</i> creditor.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Aug. 21.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">In every party there are two sorts of men, the rigid
and the supple. The rigid are an intractable race
of mortals, who act upon principle, and will not, forsooth,
fall into any measures that are not consistent
with their received notions of honour. These are
persons of a stubborn, unpliant morality, that sullenly
adhere to their friends when they are disgraced, and
to their principles, though they are exploded. I shall
therefore give up this stiff-necked generation to their
own obstinacy, and turn my thoughts to the advantage
of the supple, who pay their homage to places, and
not persons; and without enslaving themselves to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
particular scheme of opinions, are as ready to change
their conduct in point of sentiment as of fashion. The
well-disciplined part of a court are generally so perfect
at their exercise, that you may see a whole assembly,
from front to rear, face about at once to a new man of
power, though at the same time they turn their backs
upon him that brought them thither. The great hardship
these complaisant members of society are under,
seems to be the want of warning upon any approaching
change or revolution; so that they are obliged in a
hurry to tack about with every wind, and stop short
in the midst of a full career, to the great surprise and
derision of their beholders.</p>

<p>When a man foresees a decaying ministry, he has
leisure to grow a malcontent, reflect upon the present
conduct, and by gradual murmurs fall off from his
friends into a new party, by just steps and measures.
For want of such notices, I have formerly known a very
well-bred person refuse to return a bow of a man whom
he thought in disgrace, that was next day made Secretary
of State; and another, who after a long neglect of a
minister, came to his levee, and made professions of zeal
for his service the very day before he was turned out.</p>

<p>This produces also unavoidable confusions and mistakes
in the descriptions of great men's parts and merits.
That ancient lyric, Mr. D'Urfey,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> some years ago wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>a dedication to a certain lord, in which he celebrated
him for the greatest poet and critic of that age, upon
a misinformation in Dyer's Letter<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>, that his noble patron
was made Lord Chamberlain. In short, innumerable
votes, speeches, and sermons have been thrown away,
and turned to no account, merely for want of due and
timely intelligence. Nay, it has been known, that a
panegyric has been half printed off, when the poet, upon
the removal of the minister, has been forced to alter it
into a satire.</p>

<p>For the conduct therefore of such useful persons as
are ready to do their country service upon all occasions,
I have an engine in my study, which is a sort of a
Political Barometer, or, to speak more intelligibly, a
State Weather-Glass, that, by the rising and falling of
a certain magical liquor, presages all changes and revolutions
in government, as the common glass does
those of the weather. This weather-glass is said to
have been invented by Cardan,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and given by him as a
present to his great countryman and contemporary
Machiavel, which (by the way) may serve to rectify a
received error in chronology, that places one of these
some years after the other. How or when it came into
my hands, I shall desire to be excused if I keep to
myself; but so it is, that I have walked by it for the
better part of a century, to my safety at least, if not to
my advantage; and have among my papers, a register
of all the changes that happened in it from the middle
of Queen Elizabeth's reign.</p>

<p>In the time of that princess, it stood long at Settled
Fair. At the latter end of King James the First, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>fell to Cloudy. It held several years after at Stormy;
insomuch that at last despairing of seeing any clear
weather at home, I followed the royal exile, and
some time after finding my glass rise, returned to
my native country with the rest of the loyalists. I
was then in hopes to pass the remainder of my days
in Settled Fair: but alas! during the greatest part
of that reign, the English nation lay in a Dead Calm,
which, as it is usual, was followed by high winds and
tempests till of late years: in which, with unspeakable
joy and satisfaction, I have seen our political weather
returned to Settled Fair. I must only observe, that
for all this last summer my glass has pointed at Changeable.
Upon the whole, I often apply to Fortune &AElig;neas's
speech to the sybil:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14"><em>&mdash;&mdash;Non ulla laborum,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>O virgo, nova mi fades inopinave surgit:</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Omnia pr&aelig;cepi, atque animo me cum ante peregi.</em><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The advantages which have accrued to those whom
I have advised in their affairs, by virtue of this sort of
prescience, have been very considerable. A nephew
of mine, who has never put his money into the stocks,
or taken it out, without my advice, has in a few years
raised five hundred pounds to almost so many thousands.
As for myself, who look upon riches to consist rather
in content than possessions, and measure the greatness
of the mind rather by its tranquillity than its ambition,
I have seldom used my glass to make my way in the
world, but often to retire from it. This is a by-path
to happiness, which was first discovered to me by a
most pleasing apothegm of Pythagoras: "When the
winds," says he, "rise, worship the echo." That great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
philosopher (whether to make his doctrines the more
venerable, or to gild his precepts with the beauty of
imagination, or to awaken the curiosity of his disciples;
for I will not suppose what is usually said, that he did
it to conceal his wisdom from the vulgar) has couched
several admirable precepts in remote allusions and
mysterious sentences. By the winds in this apothegm,
are meant State hurricanes and popular tumults. "When
these arise," says he, "worship the echo;" that is, withdraw
yourself from the multitude into deserts, woods,
solitudes, or the like retirements, which are the usual
habitations of the echo.</p>

From <em>Tuesday, Aug. 22</em>, to <em>Thursday, Aug. 24, 1710</em>.</h2>


<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Aug. 23.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Lysander has written to me out of the country, and tells
me, after many other circumstances, that he had
passed a great deal of time with much pleasure and
tranquillity, till his happiness was interrupted by an
indiscreet flatterer, who came down into those parts to
visit a relation. With the circumstances in which he
represents the matter, he had no small provocation to be
offended, for he attacked him in so wrong a season, that
he could not have any relish of pleasure in it; though,
perhaps, at another time, it might have passed upon him
without giving him much uneasiness. Lysander had,
after a long satiety of the town, been so happy as to get
to a solitude he extremely liked, and recovered a pleasure
he had long discontinued, that of reading. He was got
to the bank of a rivulet, covered by a pleasing shade, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
fanned by a soft breeze, which threw his mind into that
sort of composure and attention in which a man, though
with indolence, enjoys the utmost liveliness of his spirits,
and the greatest strength of his mind at the same time.
In this state, Lysander represents that he was reading
Virgil's "Georgics"; when on a sudden the gentleman
above-mentioned surprised him, and, without any manner
of preparation, falls upon him at once. "What! I have
found you out at last, after searching all over the wood.
We wanted you at cards after dinner, but you are much
better employed. I have heard indeed that you are an
excellent scholar: but at the same time, is it not a little
unkind to rob the ladies, who like you so well, of the
pleasure of your company? But that is indeed the misfortune
of you great scholars, you are seldom so fit for
the world as those who never trouble themselves with
books. Well, I see you are taken up with your learning
there, and I'll leave you." Lysander says, he made him
no answer, but took a resolution to complain to me.</p>

<p>It is a substantial affliction, when men govern themselves
by the rules of good-breeding, that by the very
force of them they are subjected to the insolence of those
who either never will, or never can, understand them.
The superficial part of mankind form to themselves little
measures of behaviour from the outside of things. By
the force of these narrow conceptions, they act amongst
themselves with applause, and do not apprehend they are
contemptible to those of higher understanding, who are
restrained by decencies above their knowledge from
showing a dislike. Hence it is, that because complaisance
is a good quality in conversation, one impertinent
takes upon him on all occasions to commend; and
because mirth is agreeable, another thinks fit eternally
to jest. I have of late received many packets of letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
complaining of these spreading evils. A lady who is
lately arrived at the Bath acquaints me, there was in the
stage-coach wherein she went down, a common flatterer,
and a common jester. These gentlemen were (she tells
me) rivals in her favour; and adds, if there ever happened
a case wherein of two persons one was not liked
more than another, it was in that journey. They
differed only in proportion to the degree of dislike
between the nauseous and the insipid. Both these characters
of men are born out of a barrenness of imagination.
They are never fools by nature, but become such out of
an impotent ambition of being what she never intended
them, men of wit and conversation. I therefore think
fit to declare, that according to the known laws of this
land, a man may be a very honest gentleman, and enjoy
himself and his friend, without being a wit; and I
absolve all men from taking pains to be such for the
future. As the present case stands, is it not very unhappy
that Lysander must be attacked and applauded in
a wood, and Corinna jolted and commended in a stage-coach;
and this for no manner of reason, but because
other people have a mind to show their parts? I grant
indeed, if these people (as they have understanding
enough for it) would confine their accomplishments to
those of their own degree of talents, it were to be
tolerated; but when they are so insolent as to interrupt
the meditations of the wife, the conversations of the
agreeable, and the whole behaviour of the modest, it
becomes a grievance naturally in my jurisdiction. Among
themselves, I cannot only overlook, but approve it. I
was present the other day at a conversation, where a
man of this height of breeding and sense told a young
woman of the same form, "To be sure, madam, everything
must please that comes from a lady." She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
answered, "I know, sir, you are so much a gentleman
that you think so." Why, this is very well on both
sides; and it is impossible that such a gentleman and
lady should do other than think well of one another.
These are but loose hints of the disturbances in human
society, of which there is yet no remedy; but I shall in
a little time publish tables of respect and civility, by
which persons may be instructed in the proper times and
seasons, as well as at what degree of intimacy a man may
be allowed to commend or rally his companions; the
promiscuous licence of which is at present far from
being among the small errors in conversation.</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em>&mdash;The following letter was left, with a request to
be immediately answered, lest the artifices used against a
lady in distress may come into common practice:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"My elder sister buried her husband about six months
ago; and at his funeral, a gentleman of more
art than honesty, on the night of his interment, while
she was not herself, but in the utmost agony of her grief,
spoke to her of the subject of love. In that weakness
and distraction which my sister was in (as one ready to
fall is apt to lean on anybody), he obtained her promise
of marriage, which was accordingly consummated
eleven weeks after. There is no affliction comes alone,
but one brings another. My sister is now ready to
lie-in. She humbly asks of you, as you are a friend to
the sex, to let her know who is the lawful father of this
child, or whether she may not be relieved from this
second marriage, considering it was promised under such
circumstances as one may very well suppose she did not
what she did voluntarily, but because she was helpless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
otherwise. She is advised something about engagements
made in gaol, which she thinks the same as to the reason
of the thing. But, dear sir, she relies upon your advice,
and gives you her service; as does</p>

<p>The case is very hard; and I fear, the plea she is
advised to make, from the similitude of a man who is
in duress, will not prevail. But though I despair of
remedy as to the mother, the law gives the child his
choice of his father where the birth is thus legally
ambiguous.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Aug. 25.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Nature is full of wonders; every atom is a standing
miracle, and endowed with such qualities as could
not be impressed on it by a power and wisdom less than
infinite. For this reason, I would not discourage any
searches that are made into the most minute and trivial
parts of the creation. However, since the world abounds
in the noblest fields of speculation, it is, methinks, the
mark of a little genius to be wholly conversant among
insects, reptiles, animalcules, and those trifling rarities
that furnish out the apartment of a virtuoso.</p>

<p>There are some men whose heads are so oddly turned
this way, that though they are utter strangers to the
common occurrences of life, they are able to discover the
sex of a cockle, or describe the generation of a mite, in
all its circumstances. They are so little versed in the
world, that they scarce know a horse from an ox; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
at the same time will tell you, with a great deal of
gravity, that a flea is a rhinoceros, and a snail an hermaphrodite.
I have known one of these whimsical
philosophers who has set a greater value upon a collection
of spiders than he would upon a flock of sheep, and
has sold his coat off his back to purchase a tarantula.</p>

<p>I would not have a scholar wholly unacquainted with
these secrets and curiosities of nature; but certainly the
mind of man, that is capable of so much higher contemplations,
should not be altogether fixed upon such mean
and disproportioned objects. Observations of this kind
are apt to alienate us too much from the knowledge of
the world, and to make us serious upon trifles, by which
means they expose philosophy to the ridicule of the witty,
and contempt of the ignorant. In short, studies of this
nature should be the diversions, relaxations, and amusements;
not the care, business, and concern of life.</p>

<p>It is indeed wonderful to consider, that there should
be a sort of learned men who are wholly employed in
gathering together the refuse of nature, if I may call it
so, and hoarding up in their chests and cabinets such
creatures as others industriously avoid the sight of. One
does not know how to mention some of the most precious
parts of their treasure without a kind of an apology for
it. I have been shown a beetle valued at twenty crowns,
and a toad at a hundred: but we must take this for a
general rule, that whatever appears trivial or obscene in
the common notions of the world, looks grave and philosophical
in the eye of a virtuoso.</p>

<p>To show this humour in its perfection, I shall present
my reader with the legacy of a certain virtuoso, who laid
out a considerable estate in natural rarities and curiosities,
which upon his death-bed he bequeathed to his relations
and friends, in the following words:</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Aug. 28.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">As I was passing by a neighbour's house this morning,
I overheard the wife of the family speak things to
her husband which gave me much disturbance, and put
me in mind of a character which I wonder I have so
long omitted, and that is, an outrageous species of the
fair sex which is distinguished by the term Scolds.
The generality of women are by nature loquacious:
therefore mere volubility of speech is not to be imputed
to them, but should be considered with pleasure when
it is used to express such passions as tend to sweeten
or adorn conversation: but when, through rage, females
are vehement in their eloquence, nothing in the world
has so ill an effect upon the features; for by the force
of it, I have seen the most amiable become the most
deformed, and she that appeared one of the Graces,
immediately turned into one of the Furies. I humbly
conceive, the great cause of this evil may proceed from
a false notion the ladies have of what we call a modest
woman. They have too narrow a conception of this
lovely character, and believe they have not at all
forfeited their pretensions to it, provided they have
no imputations on their chastity. But alas! the young
fellows know they pick out better women in the side-boxes<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
than many of those who pass upon the world
and themselves for modest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Modesty never rages, never murmurs, never pouts:
when it is ill-treated, it pines, it beseeches, it languishes.
The neighbour I mention is one of your common
modest women, that is to say, those as are ordinarily
reckoned such. Her husband knows every pain in life
with her but jealousy. Now because she is clear in this
particular, the man can't say his soul is his own, but
she cries, "No modest woman is respected nowadays."
What adds to the comedy in this case is, that it is very
ordinary with this sort of women to talk in the language
of distress: they will complain of the forlorn wretchedness
of their condition, and then the poor helpless
creatures shall throw the next thing they can lay their
hands on at the person who offends them. Our neighbour
was only saying to his wife, she went a little too
fine, when she immediately pulled his periwig off, and
stamping it under her feet, wrung her hands, and said,
"Never modest woman was so used." These ladies of
irresistible modesty are those who make virtue unamiable;
not that they can be said to be virtuous, but as they live
without scandal; and being under the common denomination
of being such, men fear to meet their faults
in those who are as agreeable as they are innocent.</p>

<p>I take the bully among men, and the scold among
women, to draw the foundation of their actions from
the same defect in the mind. A bully thinks honour
consists wholly in being brave, and therefore has regard
to no one rule of life, if he preserves himself from the
accusation of cowardice. The froward woman knows
chastity to be the first merit in a woman; and therefore,
since no one can call her one ugly name, she calls all
mankind all the rest.</p>

<p>These ladies, where their companions are so imprudent
as to take their speeches for any other than exercises of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
their own lungs, and their husband's patience, gain by
the force of being resisted, and flame with open fury,
which is no way to be opposed but by being neglected:
though at the same time human frailty makes it very
hard to relish the philosophy of contemning even
frivolous reproach. There is a very pretty instance
of this infirmity in the man of the best sense that ever
was, no less a person than Adam himself. According
to Milton's description of the first couple, as soon as
they had fallen, and the turbulent passions of anger,
hatred, and jealousy first entered their breasts, Adam
grew moody, and talked to his wife, as you may find it
in the 359th page, and ninth book, of "Paradise Lost,"
in the octavo edition, which out of heroics, and put into
domestic style, would run thus:</p>

<p>"Madam, if my advice had been of any authority
with you when that strange desire of gadding possessed
you this morning, we had still been happy: but your
cursed vanity and opinion of your own conduct, which
is certainly very wavering when it seeks occasions of
being proved, has ruined both yourself, and me who
trusted you."</p>

<p>Eve had no fan in her hand to ruffle, or tucker to
pull down,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> but with a reproachful air she answered:</p>

<p>"Sir, do you impute that to my desire of gadding,
which might have happened to yourself with all your
wisdom and gravity? The serpent spoke so excellently,
and with so good a grace, that&mdash;Besides, what harm
had I ever done him, that he should design me any?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Was I to have been always at your side, I might as well
have continued there, and been but your rib still: but
if I was so weak a creature as you thought me, why did
you not interpose your sage authority more absolutely?
You denied me going as faintly, as you say I resisted
the serpent. Had not you been too easy, neither you
or I had now transgressed."</p>

<p>Adam replied, "Why, Eve, hast thou the impudence
to upbraid me as the cause of thy transgression for my
indulgence to thee? Thus it will ever be with him who
trusts too much to woman: at the same time that she
refuses to be governed, if she suffers by her obstinacy,
she will accuse the man that shall leave her to herself."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Thus they in mutual accusation spent</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning:</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>And of their vain contest appeared no end.</em><a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a><br /></span>

<p>This to the modern will appear but a very faint piece
of conjugal enmity; but you are to consider, that they
were but just begun to be angry, and they wanted new
words for expressing their new passions. But her accusing
him of letting her go, and telling him how good a
speaker and how fine a gentleman the devil was, we
must reckon, allowing for the improvements of time,
that she gave him the same provocation as if she had
called him cuckold. The passionate and familiar terms
with which the same case, repeated daily for so many
thousand years, has furnished the present generation,
were not then in use; but the foundation of debate has
ever been the same, a contention about their merit and
wisdom. Our general mother was a beauty, and hearing
there was another now in the world, could not forbear
(as Adam tells her) showing herself, though to the devil,
by whom the same vanity made her liable to be betrayed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p>I cannot, with all the help of science and astrology,
find any other remedy for this evil, but what was the
medicine in this first quarrel; which was, as appeared in
the next book, that they were convinced of their being
both weak, but one weaker than the other.</p>

<p>If it were possible that the beauteous could but rage
a little before a glass, and see their pretty countenances
grow wild, it is not to be doubted but it would have a
very good effect; but that would require temper: for
Lady Firebrand, upon observing her features swell when
her maid vexed her the other day, stamped her dressing-glass
under her feet. In this case, when one of this
temper is moved, she is like a witch in an operation, and
makes all things turn round with her. The very fabric
is in a vertigo when she begins to charm. In an instant,
whatever was the occasion that moved her blood, she has
such intolerable servants, Betty is so awkward, Tom can't
carry a message, and her husband has so little respect
for her, that she, poor woman, is weary of this life, and
was born to be unhappy.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Aug. 30.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I chanced to rise very early one particular morning this
summer, and took a walk into the country to divert
myself among the fields and meadows, while the green
was new, and the flowers in their bloom. As at this
season of the year every lane is a beautiful walk, and
every hedge full of nosegays, I lost myself with a great
deal of pleasure among several thickets and bushes that
were filled with a great variety of birds, and an agreeable
confusion of notes, which formed the pleasantest scene
in the world to one who had passed a whole winter in
noise and smoke. The freshness of the dews that lay
upon everything about me, with the cool breath of the
morning, which inspired the birds with so many delightful
instincts, created in me the same kind of animal
pleasure, and made my heart overflow with such secret
emotions of joy and satisfaction as are not to be described
or accounted for. On this occasion I could not but
reflect upon a beautiful simile in Milton:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>As one who long in populous city pent,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Forth issuing on a summer's morn to breathe</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Among the pleasant villages and farms</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight:</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>The smell of grain, or tedded<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> grass, or kine,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound.</em><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who are conversant in the writings of polite
authors, receive an additional entertainment from the
country, as it revives in their memories those charming
descriptions with which such authors do frequently
abound.</p>

<p>I was thinking of the foregoing beautiful simile in
Milton, and applying it to myself, when I observed to
the windward of me a black cloud falling to the earth in
long trails of rain, which made me betake myself for
shelter to a house which I saw at a little distance from
the place where I was walking. As I sat in the porch, I
heard the voices of two or three persons, who seemed
very earnest in discourse. My curiosity was raised when
I heard the names of Alexander the Great and Artaxerxes;
and as their talk seemed to run on ancient heroes, I concluded
there could not be any secret in it; for which
reason I thought I might very fairly listen to what they
said.</p>

<p>After several parallels between great men, which appeared
to me altogether groundless and chimerical, I was
surprised to hear one say, that he valued the Black Prince
more than the Duke of Vend&ocirc;me. How the Duke of
Vend&ocirc;me should become a rival of the Black Prince's, I
could not conceive; and was more startled when I heard
a second affirm with great vehemence, that if the Emperor
of Germany was not going off, he should like him better
than either of them. He added, that though the season
was so changeable, the Duke of Marlborough was in
blooming beauty. I was wondering to myself from
whence they had received this odd intelligence, especially
when I heard them mention the names of several other
great generals, as the Prince of Hesse, and the King of
Sweden, who, they said, were both running away: to
which they added, what I entirely agreed with them in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
that the Crown of France was very weak, but that the
Mareschal Villars still kept his colours. At last one of
them told the company, if they would go along with
him, he would show them a chimney-sweeper and a
painted lady in the same bed, which he was sure would
very much please them. The shower which had driven
them, as well as myself, into the house, was now over:
and as they were passing by me into the garden, I asked
them to let me be one of their company.</p>

<p>The gentleman of the house told me, if I delighted in
flowers, it would be worth my while, for that he believed
he could show me such a blow of tulips as was not to be
matched in the whole country.</p>

<p>I accepted the offer, and immediately found that they
had been talking in terms of gardening, and that the
kings and generals they had mentioned were only so
many tulips, to which the gardeners, according to their
usual custom, had given such high titles and appellations
of honour.</p>

<p>I was very much pleased and astonished at the glorious
show of these gay vegetables, that arose in great profusion
on all the banks about us. Sometimes I considered
them with the eye of an ordinary spectator as so many
beautiful objects, varnished over with a natural gloss,
and stained with such a variety of colours as are not to
be equalled in any artificial dyes or tinctures. Sometimes
I considered every leaf as an elaborate piece of
tissue, in which the threads and fibres were woven together
into different configurations, which gave a different
colouring to the light as it glanced on the several parts
of the surface. Sometimes I considered the whole bed
of tulips, according to the notion of the greatest mathematician
and philosopher that ever lived,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> as a multitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>of optic instruments, designed for the separating light
into all those various colours of which it is composed.</p>

<p>I was awakened out of these my philosophical speculations,
by observing the company often seemed to laugh
at me. I accidentally praised a tulip as one of the finest
that I ever saw; upon which they told me, it was a
common fool's-coat. Upon that I praised a second,
which it seems was but another kind of fool's-coat. I
had the same fate with two or three more; for which
reason I desired the owner of the garden to let me know
which were the finest of the flowers, for that I was so
unskilful in the art, that I thought the most beautiful
were the most valuable, and that those which had the
gayest colours were the most beautiful. The gentleman
smiled at my ignorance: he seemed a very plain honest
man, and a person of good sense, had not his head been
touched with that distemper which Hippocrates calls the
&#932;&#965;&#955;&#953;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#945; (Tulippomania); insomuch that he would
talk very rationally on any subject in the world but a
tulip.</p>

<p>He told me, that he valued the bed of flowers which
lay before us, and was not above twenty yards in length,
and two in breadth, more than he would the best hundred
acres of land in England; and added, that it would have
been worth twice the money it is, if a foolish cook-maid
of his had not almost ruined him the last winter, by mistaking
a handful of tulip-roots for a heap of onions, "and
by that means," says he, "made me a dish of porridge,
that cost me above &pound;1000 sterling." He then showed
me what he thought the finest of his tulips, which I
found received all their value from their rarity and oddness,
and put me in mind of your great fortunes, which
are not always the greatest beauties.</p>

<p>I have often looked upon it as a piece of happiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
that I have never fallen into any of these fantastical
tastes, nor esteemed anything the more for its being
uncommon and hard to be met with. For this reason,
I look upon the whole country in spring-time as a
spacious garden, and make as many visits to a spot of
daisies, or a bank of violets, as a florist does to his
borders and parterres. There is not a bush in blossom
within a mile of me which I am not acquainted with,
nor scarce a daffodil or cowslip that withers away in my
neighbourhood without my missing it. I walked home in
this temper of mind through several fields and meadows
with an unspeakable pleasure, not without reflecting on
the bounty of Providence, which has made the most
pleasing and most beautiful objects the most ordinary
and most common.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Sept. 1.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Never were men so perplexed as a select company of
us were this evening with a couple of possessed
wits, who through our ill fortune, and their own confidence,
had thought fit to pin themselves upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
gentleman who had owned to them that he was going
to meet such and such persons, and named us one by
one. These pert puppies immediately resolved to come
with him, and from the beginning to the end of the
night entertained each other with impertinences, to
which we were perfect strangers. I am come home very
much tired; for the affliction was so irksome to me, that
it surpasses all other I ever knew, insomuch that I cannot
reflect upon this sorrow with pleasure, though it is past.</p>

<p>An easy manner of conversation is the most desirable
quality a man can have; and for that reason coxcombs
will take upon them to be familiar with people whom
they never saw before. What adds to the vexation of it
is, that they will act upon the foot of knowing you by
fame, and rally with you, as they call it, by repeating
what your enemies say of you; and court you, as they
think, by uttering to your face at a wrong time all the
kind things your friends speak of you in your absence.</p>

<p>These people are the more dreadful, the more they
have of what is usually called wit: for a lively imagination,
when it is not governed by a good understanding,
makes such miserable havoc both in conversation and
business, that it lays you defenceless, and fearful to
throw the least word in its way that may give it new
matter for its further errors.</p>

<p>Tom Mercett has as quick a fancy as any one living;
but there is no reasonable man can bear him half-an-hour.
His purpose is to entertain, and it is of no consequence
to him what is said, so it be what is called well
said; as if a man must bear a wound with patience,
because he that pushed at you came up with a good air
and mien. That part of life which we spend in company,
is the most pleasing of all our moments; and
therefore I think our behaviour in it should have its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
laws as well as the part of our being which is generally
esteemed the more important. From hence it is, that
from long experience I have made it a maxim, that
however we may pretend to take satisfaction in sprightly
mirth and high jollity, there is no great pleasure in any
company where the basis of the society is not mutual
good-will. When this is in the room, every trifling
circumstance, the most minute accident, the absurdity
of a servant, the repetition of an old story, the look of
a man when he is telling it, the most indifferent and the
most ordinary occurrences, are matters which produce
mirth and good-humour. I went to spend an hour
after this manner with some friends who enjoy it in
perfection whenever they meet, when those destroyers
above-mentioned came in upon us. There is not a man
among them has any notion of distinction of superiority
to one another, either in their fortunes or their talents,
when they are in company. Or if any reflection to the
contrary occurs in their thoughts, it only strikes a delight
upon their minds, that so much wisdom and power is in
possession of one whom they love and esteem.</p>

<p>In these my Lucubrations, I have frequently dwelt upon
this one topic. It would make short work for us reformers,
for it is only want of making this a position
that renders some characters bad which would otherwise
be good. Tom Mercett means no man ill, but does ill
to everybody. His ambition is to be witty; and to carry
on that design, he breaks through all things that other
people hold sacred. If he thought wit was no way to be
used but to the advantage of society, that sprightliness
would have a new turn, and we should expect what he is
going to say with satisfaction instead of fear. It is no
excuse for being mischievous, that a man is mischievous
without malice: nor will it be thought an atonement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
that the ill was done not to injure the party concerned,
but to divert the indifferent.</p>

<p>It is, methinks, a very great error that we should not profess
honesty in conversation as much as in commerce. If
we consider that there is no greater misfortune than to be
ill received where we love the turning a man to ridicule
among his friends, we rob him of greater enjoyments
than he could have purchased by his wealth; yet he that
laughs at him, would perhaps be the last man who would
hurt him in this case of less consequence. It has been
said, the history of Don Quixote utterly destroyed the
spirit of gallantry in the Spanish nation; and I believe
we may say much more truly, that the humour of ridicule
has done as much injury to the true relish of
company in England.</p>

<p>Such satisfactions as arise from the secret comparison
of ourselves to others, with relation to their inferior fortunes
or merit, are mean and unworthy. The true and
high state of conversation is when men communicate
their thoughts to each other upon such subjects, and in
such a manner, as would be pleasant if there were no
such thing as folly in the world; for it is but a low
condition of wit in one man which depends upon folly
in another.</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em>&mdash;I was here interrupted by the receipt of my
letters, among which is one from a lady, who is not a
little offended at my translation of the discourse between
Adam and Eve.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> She pretends to tell me my own, as
she calls it, and quotes several passages in my works
which tend to the utter disunion of man and wife. Her
epistle will best express her. I have made an extract of
it, and shall insert the most material passages:</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Sept. 4.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Having received many letters filled with compliments
and acknowledgments for my late useful discovery
of the Political Barometer,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> I shall here communicate to
the public an account of my Ecclesiastical Thermometer,
the latter giving as manifest prognostications of the
changes and revolutions in Church as the former does of
those in State, and both of them being absolutely necessary
for every prudent subject who is resolved to keep
what he has, and get what he can.</p>

<p>The Church thermometer, which I am now to treat
of, is supposed to have been invented in the reign of
Henry the Eighth, about the time when that religious
prince put some to death for owning the Pope's supremacy,
and others for denying transubstantiation. I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
not find, however, any great use made of this instrument
till it fell into the hands of a learned and vigilant
priest or minister (for he frequently wrote himself
both one and the other), who was some time Vicar
of Bray. This gentleman lived in his vicarage to a
good old age; and after having seen several successions
of his neighbouring clergy either burnt or banished,
departed this life with the satisfaction of having never
deserted his flock, and died Vicar of Bray. As this glass
was first designed to calculate the different degrees of
heat in religion, as it raged in Popery, or as it cooled
and grew temperate in the Reformation, it was marked
at several distances, after the manner our ordinary thermometer
is to this day, viz., Extreme Hot, Sultry Hot,
Very Hot, Hot, Warm, Temperate, Cold, Just Freezing,
Frost, Hard Frost, Great Frost, Extreme Cold.</p>

<p>It is well known, that Toricellius, the inventor of the
common weather-glass, made the experiment in a long
tube which held thirty-two feet of water; and that a
more modern virtuoso finding such a machine altogether
unwieldy and useless, and considering that thirty-two
inches of quicksilver weighed as much as so many feet
of water in a tube of the same circumference, invented
that sizable instrument which is now in use. After
this manner, that I might adapt the thermometer I am
now speaking of to the present constitution of our
Church, as divided into High and Low, I have made
some necessary variations both in the tube and the fluid
it contains. In the first place, I ordered a tube to be
cast in a planetary hour, and took care to seal it
hermetically, when the sun was in conjunction with
Saturn. I then took the proper precautions about the
fluid, which is a compound of two very different liquors:
one of them a spirit drawn out of a strong heady wine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the other a particular sort of rock water, colder than ice,
and clearer than crystal. The spirit is of a red fiery
colour, and so very apt to ferment, that unless it be
mingled with a proportion of the water, or pent up
very close, it will burst the vessel that holds it, and
fly up in fume and smoke. The water, on the contrary,
is of such a subtle piercing cold, that unless it be
mingled with a proportion of the spirits, it will sink
through almost everything that it is put into, and seems
to be of the same nature as the water mentioned by
Quintus Curtius, which, says the historian, could be
contained in nothing but in the hoof or (as the Oxford
manuscript has it) in the skull of an ass. The thermometer
is marked according to the following figure,
which I set down at length, not only to give my reader
a clear idea of it, but also to fill up my paper.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<ul><li>Ignorance.</li>
<li>Persecution.</li>
<li>Wrath.</li>
<li>Zeal.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Church.</span></li>
<li>Moderation.</li>
<li>Lukewarmness.</li>
<li>Infidelity.</li>
<li>Ignorance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The reader will observe, that the Church is placed
in the middle point of the glass, between Zeal and
Moderation, the situation in which she always flourishes,
and in which every good Englishman wishes her who is
a friend to the constitution of his country. However,
when it mounts to Zeal, it is not amiss; and when it
sinks to Moderation, is still in a most admirable temper.
The worst of it is, that when once it begins to rise, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
has still an inclination to ascend, insomuch that it is apt
to climb from Zeal to Wrath, and from Wrath to
Persecution, which always ends in Ignorance, and very
often proceeds from it. In the same manner it frequently
takes its progress through the lower half of
the glass; and when it has a tendency to fall, will
gradually descend from Moderation to Lukewarmness,
and from Lukewarmness to Infidelity, which very often
terminates in Ignorance, and always proceeds from it.</p>

<p>It is a common observation, that the ordinary thermometer
will be affected by the breathing of people who
are in the room where it stands; and indeed, it is almost
incredible to conceive how the glass I am now describing
will fall by the breath of a multitude crying "Popery";
or on the contrary, how it will rise when the same
multitude (as it sometimes happens) cry out in the
same breath, "The Church is in danger."</p>

<p>As soon as I had finished this my glass, and adjusted
it to the above-mentioned scale of religion, that I
might make proper experiments with it, I carried it
under my cloak to several coffee-houses, and other places
of resort about this great city. At St. James's Coffee-house,
the liquor stood at Moderation; but at Will's,
to my extreme surprise, it subsided to the very lowest
mark on the glass. At the Grecian, it mounted but
just one point higher; at the Rainbow,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> it still ascended
two degrees: Child's fetched it up to Zeal, and other
adjacent coffee-houses to Wrath.</p>

<p>It fell into the lower half of the glass as I went
farther into the city, till at length it settled at Moderation,
where it continued all the time I stayed about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the 'Change, as also whilst I passed by the Bank. And
here I cannot but take notice, that through the whole
course of my remarks, I never observed my glass to rise
at the same time that the stocks did.</p>

<p>To complete the experiment, I prevailed upon a
friend of mine, who works under me in the occult
sciences, to make a progress with my glass through the
whole island of Great Britain; and after his return, to
present me with a register of his observations. I guessed
beforehand at the temper of several places he passed
through, by the characters they have had time out of
mind. Thus that facetious divine, Dr. Fuller, speaking
of the town of Banbury near a hundred years ago, tells
us, it was a place famous for cakes and zeal, which I
find by my glass is true to this day as to the latter part
of this description; though I must confess, it is not in
the same reputation for cakes that it was in the time of
that learned author; and thus of other places. In short,
I have now by me, digested in an alphabetical order,
all the counties, corporations, and boroughs in Great
Britain, with their respective tempers, as they stand
related to my thermometer: but this I shall keep to
myself, because I would by no means do anything that
may seem to influence any ensuing elections.</p>

<p>The point of doctrine which I would propagate by
this my invention, is the same which was long ago
advanced by that able teacher Horace, out of whom I
have taken my text for this discourse: we should be
careful not to overshoot ourselves in the pursuits even
of virtue. Whether zeal or moderation be the point we
aim at, let us keep fire out of the one, and frost out of
the other. But alas! the world is too wise to want such
a precaution. The terms High Church and Low Church,
as commonly used, do not so much denote a principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
as they distinguish a party. They are like words of
battle, that have nothing to do with their original signification,
but are only given out to keep a body of men
together, and to let them know friends from enemies.</p>

<p>I must confess, I have considered with some little
attention the influence which the opinions of these great
national sects have upon their practice; and do look
upon it as one of the unaccountable things of our times,
that multitudes of honest gentlemen, who entirely agree
in their lives, should take it in their heads to differ in
their religion.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Sept. 6.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">As I was this morning going out of my house, a little
boy in a black coat delivered to me the following
letter. Upon asking who he was, he told me, that he
belonged to my Lady Gimcrack. I did not at first
recollect the name; but upon inquiry, found it to be
the widow of Sir Nicholas, whose legacy I lately gave
some account of to the world.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The letter ran thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I hope you will not be surprised to receive a letter
from the Widow Gimcrack. You know, sir, that
I have lately lost a very whimsical husband, who I find,
by one of your last week's papers, was not altogether a
stranger to you. When I married this gentleman, he
had a very handsome estate; but upon buying a set
of microscopes, he was chosen a Fellow of the Royal
Society; from which time I do not remember ever to
have heard him speak as other people did, or talk in a
manner that any of his family could understand him.
He used, however, to pass away his time very innocently
in conversation with several members of that learned
body; for which reason I never advised him against their
company for several years, till at last I found his brain
was quite turned with their discourses. The first symptom
which he discovered of his being a virtuoso, as you
call him, poor man! was about fifteen years ago, when
he gave me positive orders to turn off an old weeding-woman
that had been employed in the family for several
years. He told me at the same time, that there was no
such thing in nature as a weed, and that it was his design
to let his garden produce what it pleased; so that you
may be sure it makes a very pleasant show as it now lies.
About the same time he took a humour to ramble up
and down the country, and would often bring home with
him his pockets full of moss and pebbles. This you
may be sure gave me a heavy heart; though at the same
time I must needs say, he had the character of a very
honest man, notwithstanding he was reckoned a little
weak, till he began to sell his estate, and buy those
strange baubles that you have taken notice of. Upon
Midsummer-day last, as he was walking with me in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
fields, he saw a very odd-coloured butterfly just before
us. I observed, that he immediately changed colour,
like a man that is surprised with a piece of good luck,
and telling me that it was what he had looked for above
these twelve years, he threw off his coat, and followed it.
I lost sight of them both in less than a quarter of an
hour; but my husband continued the chase over hedge
and ditch till about sunset; at which time, as I was
afterwards told, he caught the butterfly, as she rested
herself upon a cabbage, near five miles from the place
where he first put her up. He was here lifted from the
ground by some passengers in a very fainting condition,
and brought home to me about midnight. His violent
exercise threw him into a fever, which grew upon him
by degrees, and at last carried him off. In one of the
intervals of his distemper, he called to me, and after
having excused himself for running out of his estate, he
told me, that he had always been more industrious to
improve his mind than his fortune; and that his family
must rather value themselves upon his memory as he
was a wise man, than a rich one. He then told me, that
it was a custom among the Romans, for a man to give
his slaves their liberty when he lay upon his death-bed.
I could not imagine what this meant, till after having a
little composed himself, he ordered me to bring him a
flea which he had kept for several months in a chain,
with a design, as he said, to give it its manumission.
This was done accordingly. He then made the will,
which I have since seen printed in your works word for
word. Only I must take notice, that you have omitted
the codicil, in which he left a large <i lang="la">Concha Veneris</i>, as it
is there called, to a member of the Royal Society, who
was often with him in his sickness, and assisted him in
his will. And now, sir, I come to the chief business of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
my letter, which is, to desire your friendship and assistance
in the disposal of those many rarities and curiosities
which lie upon my hands. If you know any one that
has an occasion for a parcel of dried spiders, I will sell
them a pennyworth.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> I could likewise let any one have
a bargain of cockle-shells. I would also desire your
advice, whether I had best sell my beetles in a lump, or
by retail. The gentleman above mentioned, who was
my husband's friend, would have me make an auction of
all his goods, and is now drawing up a catalogue of every
particular for that purpose, with the two following words
in great letters over the head of them, <i lang="la">Auctio Gimcrackiana</i>.
But upon talking with him, I begin to suspect he is as
mad as poor Sir Nicholas was. Your advice in all these
particulars will be a great piece of charity to,</p>

<p>

<span style="margin-left: 20.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Elizabeth Gimcrack</span>."</span><br />
</p>

<p>I shall answer the foregoing letter, and give the widow
my best advice, as soon as I can find out chapmen for
the wares which she has to put off. In the meantime,
I shall give my reader the sight of a letter which I
have received from another female correspondent by the
same post.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Good Mr. Bickerstaff</span>,<br />

<p class="drop-cap">"I am convinced by a late paper of yours,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> that a
passionate woman (which among the common
people goes under the name of a scold) is one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>most insupportable creatures in the world. But alas!
sir, what can we do? I have made a thousand vows
and resolutions every morning to guard myself against
this frailty, but have generally broken them before
dinner, and could never in my life hold out till the
second course was set upon the table. What most
troubles me is, that my husband is as patient and good-natured
as your own Worship, or any man living can be.
Pray give me some directions, for I would observe the
strictest and severest rules you can think of to cure
myself of this distemper, which is apt to fall into my

<p>In answer to this most unfortunate lady, I must
acquaint her, that there is now in town an ingenious
physician of my acquaintance, who undertakes to cure all
the vices and defects of the mind by inward medicines,
or outward applications. I shall give the world an account
of his patients and his cures in other papers, when
I shall be more at leisure to treat upon this subject. I
shall only here inform my correspondent, that for the
benefit of such ladies that are troubled with virulent
tongues, he has prepared a cold bath, over which there is
fastened, at the end of a long pole, a very convenient
chair, curiously gilt and carved. When the patient is
seated in this chair, the doctor lifts up the pole, and gives
her two or three total immersions in the cold bath, till
such time as she has quite lost the use of speech. This
operation so effectually chills the tongue, and refrigerates
the blood, that a woman, who at her entrance into the
chair is extremely passionate and sonorous, will come out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
as silent and gentle as a lamb. The doctor told me,
he would not practise this experiment upon women of
fashion, had not he seen it made upon those of meaner
condition with very good effect.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Sept. 8.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Whereas by letters from Nottingham we have advice,
that the young ladies of that place complain for
want of sleep, by reason of certain riotous lovers, who
for this last summer have very much infested the streets
of that eminent city with violins and bass-viols, between
the hours of twelve and four in the morning, to the great
disturbance of many of her Majesty's peaceable subjects.
And whereas I have been importuned to publish some
edict against these midnight alarms, which, under the
name of serenades, do greatly annoy many well-disposed
persons, not only in the place above mentioned, but also
in most of the polite towns of this island.</p>

<p>I have taken that matter into my serious consideration,
and do find, that this custom is by no means to be
indulged in this country and climate.</p>

<p>It is indeed very unaccountable, that most of our
British youth should take such great delight in these
nocturnal expeditions. Your robust true-born Briton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
that has not yet felt the force of flames and darts, has
a natural inclination to break windows; while those
whose natural ruggedness has been soothed and softened
by gentle passion, have as strong a propensity to languish
under them, especially if they have a fiddler behind them
to utter their complaints: for as the custom prevails at
present, there is scarce a young man of any fashion in a
corporation who does not make love with the town music.
The waits often help him through his courtship; and
my friend Mr. Banister<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> has told me, he was proffered
five hundred pounds by a young fellow to play but for
one winter under the window of a lady that was a great
fortune, but more cruel than ordinary. One would think
they hoped to conquer their mistresses' hearts as people
tame hawks and eagles, by keeping them awake, or breaking
their sleep when they are fallen into it.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to search into the original of this
impertinent way of making love, which, according to
some authors, is of great antiquity. If we may believe
Monsieur Dacier and other critics, Horace's tenth ode of
the third book was originally a serenade. And if I was
disposed to show my learning, I could produce a line of
him in another place, which seems to have been the
burthen of an old heathen serenade.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----Audis minus et minus jam:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Me tuo longas pereunte noctes,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>But notwithstanding the opinions of many learned men
upon this subject, I rather agree with them who look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>upon this custom, as now practised, to have been introduced
by castrated musicians, who found out this way of
applying themselves to their mistresses at these hours,
when men of hoarser voices express their passions in
a more vulgar method. It must be confessed, that your
Italian eunuchs do practise this manner of courtship to
this day.</p>

<p>But whoever were the persons that first thought of the
serenade, the authors of all countries are unanimous in
ascribing the invention to Italy.</p>

<p>There are two circumstances which qualified that
country above all other for this midnight music.</p>

<p>The first I shall mention, was the softness of their
climate.</p>

<p>This gave the lover opportunities of being abroad in
the air, or of lying upon the earth whole hours together,
without fear of damps or dews; but as for our tramontane
lovers, when they begin their midnight complaint
with,</p>

<p class="center"><em>My lodging it is on the cold ground,</em><a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
</p>

<p>we are not to understand them in the rigour of the
letter, since it would be impossible for a British swain
to condole himself long in that situation without really
dying for his mistress. A man might as well serenade
in Greenland as in our region. Milton seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
had in his thoughts the absurdity of these Northern
serenades in the censure which he passes upon them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14"><em>&mdash;&mdash;Or midnight ball,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Or serenade, which the starved lover sings</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.</em><a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The truth of it is, I have often pitied, in a winter
night, a vocal musician, and have attributed many of his
trills and quavers to the coldness of the weather.</p>

<p>The second circumstance which inclined the Italians to
this custom, was that musical genius which is so universal
among them. Nothing is more frequent in that country
than to hear a cobbler working to an opera tune. You
can scarce see a porter that has not one nail much longer
than the rest, which you will find, upon inquiry, is
cherished for some instrument. In short, there is not
a labourer, or handicraft-man, that in the cool of the
evening does not relieve himself with solos and sonatas.</p>

<p>The Italian soothes his mistress with a plaintive voice,
and bewails himself in such melting music that the whole
neighbourhood sympathises with him in his sorrow:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Qualis populea m&#339;rens Philomela sub umbra ...</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Flet noctem, ramoque sedens miserabile carmen</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Integrat, et m&#339;stis late loca questibus implet.</em><a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the contrary, our honest countrymen have so little
an inclination to music, that they seldom begin to sing
till they are drunk, which also is usually the time when
they are most disposed to serenade.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Sept. 11.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have been very much solicited by Clarinda, Flavia,
and Lysetta, to reassume my discourse concerning
the methods of disposing honourably the unmarried part
of the world,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and taking off those bars to it, jointures
and settlements, which are not only the greatest impediments
towards entering into that state, but also the
frequent causes of distrust and animosity in it after it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>consummated. I have with very much attention considered
the case; and among all the observations that I
have made through a long course of years, I have thought
the coldness of wives to their husbands, as well as disrespect
from children to parents, to arise from this one
source. This trade for minds and bodies in the lump,
without regard to either, but as they are accompanied
with such sums of money, and such parcels of land,
cannot but produce a commerce between the parties concerned
suitable to the mean motives upon which they at
first came together. I have heretofore given an account
that this method of making settlements was first invented
by a griping lawyer, who made use of the covetous tempers
of the parents of each side to force two young people into
these vile measures of diffidence, for no other end but to
increase the skins of parchment, by which they were put
into each other's possession out of each other's power.
The law of our country has given an ample and generous
provision for the wife, even the third of the husband's
estate, and left to her good-humour and his gratitude
the expectation of further provision; but the fantastical
method of going further, with relation to their heirs,
has a foundation in nothing but pride and folly: for as
all men wish their children as like themselves, and as
much better as they can possibly, it seems monstrous
that we should give out of ourselves the opportunities
of rewarding and discouraging them according to their
deserts. This wise institution has no more sense in it
than if a man should begin a deed with, "Whereas no
man living knows how long he shall continue to be a
reasonable creature, or an honest man: and whereas I
B. am going to enter in the state of matrimony with
Mrs. D., therefore I shall from henceforth make it indifferent
to me whether from this time forward I shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
a fool or a knave: and therefore in full and perfect
health of body, and as sound mind, not knowing which
of my children will prove better or worse, I give to my
first-born, be he perverse, ungrateful, impious, or cruel,
the lump and bulk of my estate, and leave one year's
purchase only to each of my younger children, whether
they shall be brave or beautiful, modest or honourable,
from the time of the date hereof wherein I resign my
senses, and hereby promise to employ my judgment no
further in the distribution of my worldly goods from
the day of the date hereof, hereby further confessing and
covenanting, that I am from henceforth married and dead
in law."</p>

<p>There is no man that is conversant in modern settlements,
but knows this is an exact translation of what
is inserted in these instruments. Men's passions could
only make them submit to such terms; and therefore all
unreasonable bargains in marriage ought to be set aside,
as well as deeds extorted from men under force or in
prison, who are altogether as much masters of their
actions as he that is possessed with a violent passion.</p>

<p>How strangely men are sometimes partial to themselves
appears by the rapine of him that has a daughter's
beauty under his direction. He will make no scruple of
using it to force from her lover as much of his estate as
is worth &pound;10,000, and at the same time, as a Justice on
the Bench, will spare no pains to get a man hanged that
has taken but a horse from him.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped the Legislature will in due time take
this kind of robbery into consideration, and not suffer
men to prey upon each other when they are about making
the most solemn league, and entering into the strictest
bonds. The only sure remedy is to fix a certain rate on
every woman's fortune; one price for that of a maid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and another for a widow: for it is of infinite advantage,
that there should be no frauds or uncertainties in the
sale of our women.</p>

<p>If any man should exceed the settled rate, he ought to
be at liberty after seven years are over (by which time his
love may be supposed to abate a little, if it is not founded
upon reason) to renounce the bargain, and be freed from
the settlement upon restoring the portion; as a youth
married under fourteen years old may be off if he pleases
when he comes to that age, and as a man is discharged
from all bargains but that of marriage made when he is
under twenty-one.</p>

<p>It grieves me when I consider, that these restraints
upon matrimony take away the advantage we should
otherwise have over other countries, which are sunk
much by those great checks upon propagation, the convents.
It is thought chiefly owing to these that Italy
and Spain want above half their complement of people.
Were the price of wives always fixed and settled, it
would contribute to filling the nation more than all the
encouragements that can possibly be given to foreigners
to transplant themselves hither.</p>

<p>I therefore, as censor of Britain, till a law is made,
will lay down rules which shall be observed with penalty
of degrading all that break them into Pretty Fellows,
Smarts, Squibs, Hunting-Horns, Drums, and Bagpipes.</p>

<p>The females that are guilty of breaking my orders I
shall respectively pronounce to be Kits, Hornpipes, Dulcimers,
and Kettle-drums. Such widows as wear the spoils
of one husband I will bury if they attempt to rob another.</p>

<p>I ordain, that no woman ever demand one shilling to
be paid after her husband's death, more than the very
sum she brings him, or an equivalent for it in land.</p>

<p>That no settlement be made, in which the man settles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
on his children more than the reversion of the jointure,
or the value of it in money; so that at his death he may
in the whole be bound to pay his family but double to
what he has received. I would have the eldest, as well
as the rest, have his provision out of this.</p>

<p>When men are not able to come up to those settlements
I have proposed, I would have them receive so
much of the portion only as they can come up to, and
the rest to go to the woman by way of pin-money, or
separate maintenance. In this, I think, I determined
equally between the two sexes.</p>

<p>If any lawyer varies from these rules, or is above two
days in drawing a marriage settlement, or uses more
words in it than one skin of parchment will contain, or
takes above five pounds for drawing it, I would have
him thrown over the bar.</p>

<p>Were these rules observed, a woman with a small fortune,
and a great deal of worth, would be sure to marry
according to her deserts, if the man's estate were to be
less encumbered in proportion as her fortune is less than
he might have with others.</p>

<p>A man of a great deal of merit, and not much estate,
might be chosen for his worth; because it would not be
difficult for him to make a settlement.</p>

<p>The man that loves a woman best, would not lose her
for not being able to bid so much as another, or for not
complying with an extravagant demand.</p>

<p>A fine woman would no more be set up to auction as
she is now. When a man puts in for her, her friends
or herself take care to publish it; and the man that was
the first bidder is made no other use of but to raise the
price. He that loves her, will continue in waiting as
long as she pleases (if her fortune be thought equal to
his), and under pretence of some failure in the rent-roll,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
or difficulties in drawing the settlement, he is put off till
a better bargain is made with another.</p>

<p>All the rest of the sex that are not rich or beautiful
to the highest degree are plainly gainers, and would be
married so fast, that the least charming of them would
soon grow beauties to the bachelors.</p>

<p>Widows might be easily married, if they would not, as
they do now, set up for discreet, only by being mercenary.</p>

<p>The making matrimony cheap and easy, would be the
greatest discouragement to vice: the limiting the expense
of children would not make men ill inclined, or afraid
of having them in a regular way; and the men of merit
would not live unmarried, as they often do now, because
the goodness of a wife cannot be insured to them; but
the loss of an estate is certain, and a man would never
have the affliction of a worthless heir added to that of a
bad wife.</p>

<p>I am the more serious, large, and particular on this
subject, because my Lucubrations designed for the encouragement
of virtue cannot have the desired success as
long as this encumbrance of settlements continues upon
matrimony.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_85_85" id="Footnote_85_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> Steele (or Addison) edited this paper, but the real author
was their friend Edward Wortley Montagu, to whom the second volume
of the <cite>Tatler</cite> was dedicated. Mr. Moy Thomas says that Addison
and Steele "were in the habit of asking him for hints and heads for
papers; and there are among the Wortley Manuscripts original sketches
of essays which may be found in the <cite>Tatler</cite>." This essay on marriage
settlements "was entirely founded on Mr. Wortley's notes, and is frequently
in his own words." He quarrelled with his future father-in-law
because he objected to settle his property upon a future son, and
he eloped with Lady Mary Pierrepont in August 1712. In a letter
to Addison which accompanied the "loose hints" for this number, he
says, "What made me think so much of it was a discourse with Sir
P. King, who says that a man that settles his estate does not know
that two and two make four" ("Letters of Lady M. W. Montagu,"
ed. Moy Thomas, i. 5, 10, 62). No doubt Wortley Montagu's notes
furnished the materials for No. 199, and perhaps for No. 198 also.</p></div>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Sept. 13.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is my custom, in a dearth of news, to entertain myself
with those collections of advertisements that appear
at the end of all our public prints.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> These I consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>as accounts of news from the little world, in the same
manner that the foregoing parts of the paper are from
the great. If in one we hear that a sovereign prince
is fled from his capital city, in the other we hear of a
tradesman who hath shut up his shop, and run away.
If in one we find the victory of a general, in the other
we see the desertion of a private soldier. I must confess,
I have a certain weakness in my temper that is often
very much affected by these little domestic occurrences,
and have frequently been caught with tears in my eyes
over a melancholy advertisement.</p>

<p>But to consider this subject in its most ridiculous
lights, advertisements are of great use to the vulgar:
first of all, as they are instruments of ambition. A man
that is by no means big enough for the <cite>Gazette</cite>, may
easily creep into the advertisements; by which means
we often see an apothecary in the same paper of news
with a plenipotentiary, or a running-footman with an
ambassador. An advertisement from Piccadilly<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> goes
down to posterity with an article from Madrid; and
John Bartlet<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> of Goodman's Fields is celebrated in the
same paper with the Emperor of Germany. Thus the
fable tells us, that the wren mounted as high as the
eagle, by getting upon his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>A second use which this sort of writings have been
turned to of late years, has been the management of
controversy, insomuch that above half the advertisements
one meets with nowadays are purely polemical. The
inventors of Strops for Razors<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> have written against one
another this way for several years, and that with great
bitterness; as the whole argument <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em> in the case
of the Morning-gowns<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> is still carried on after the same
manner. I need not mention the several proprietors of
Dr. Anderson's pills;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> nor take notice of the many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>satirical works of this nature so frequently published
by Dr. Clark,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> who has had the confidence to advertise
upon that learned knight, my very worthy friend, Sir
William Read.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But I shall not interpose in their
quarrel; Sir William can give him his own in advertisements,
that, in the judgment of the impartial, are as
well penned as the doctor's.</p>

<p>The third and last use of these writings is, to inform
the world where they may be furnished with almost
everything that is necessary for life. If a man has pains
in his head, colics in his bowels, or spots in his clothes,
he may here meet with proper cures and remedies. If
a man would recover a wife or a horse that is stolen
or strayed; if he wants new sermons, electuaries,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> ass's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>milk,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> or anything else, either for his body or his mind,
this is the place to look for them in.</p>

<p>The great art in writing advertisements, is the finding
out a proper method to catch the reader's eye; without
which, a good thing may pass over unobserved, or be
lost among commissions of bankrupt. Asterisks and
hands were formerly of great use for this purpose. Of
late years, the <em>N.B.</em> has been much in fashion; as also
little cuts and figures, the invention of which we must
ascribe to the author of Spring Trusses. I must not
here omit the blind Italian character, which being scarce
legible, always fixes and detains the eye, and gives the
curious reader something like the satisfaction of prying
into a secret.</p>

<p>But the great skill in an advertiser is chiefly seen in
the style which he makes use of. He is to mention the
universal esteem, or general reputation, of things that
were never heard of. If he is a physician or astrologer,
he must change his lodgings frequently, and (though he
never saw anybody in them besides his own family) give
public notice of it, for the information of the nobility
and gentry. Since I am thus usefully employed in writing
criticisms on the works of these diminutive authors,
I must not pass over in silence an advertisement which
has lately made its appearance, and is written altogether
in a Ciceronian manner. It was sent to me, with five
shillings, to be inserted among my advertisements; but
as it is a pattern of good writing in this way, I shall give
it a place in the body of my paper:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p class="drop-cap">"The highest compounded spirit of lavender, the
most glorious (if the expression may be used)
enlivening scent and flavour that can possibly be, which
so raptures the spirits, delights the gust, and gives such
airs to the countenance, as are not to be imagined but by
those that have tried it. The meanest sort of the thing
is admired by most gentlemen and ladies; but this far
more, as by far it exceeds it, to the gaining among all a
more than common esteem. It is sold (in neat flint
bottles fit for the pocket) only at the Golden Key, in
Warton's Court, near Holborn Bars, for 3s. 6d. with
directions."</p>

<p>At the same time that I recommend the several flowers
in which this spirit of lavender is wrapped up (if the
expression may be used), I cannot excuse my fellow-labourers
for admitting into their papers several uncleanly
advertisements, not at all proper to appear in the works
of polite writers. Among these I must reckon the Carminative
Wind-expelling Pills.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> If the doctor had called
them only his carminative pills, he had been as cleanly
as one could have wished; but the second word entirely
destroys the decency of the first. There are other
absurdities of this nature so very gross, that I dare not
mention them; and shall therefore dismiss this subject,
with a public admonition to Michael Parrot,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> that he do
not presume any more to mention a certain worm he
knows of, which, by the way, has grown seven foot in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>my memory; for, if I am not much mistaken, it is the
same that was but nine foot long about six months
ago.</p>

<p>By the remarks I have here made, it plainly appears,
that a collection of advertisements is a kind of miscellany;
the writers of which, contrary to all authors, except men
of quality, give money to the booksellers who publish
their copies. The genius of the bookseller is chiefly
shown in his method of ranging and digesting these
little tracts. The last paper I took up in my hands,
places them in the following order:</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Sept. 15.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The hours which we spend in conversation are the
most pleasing of any which we enjoy; yet, methinks,
there is very little care taken to improve ourselves
for the frequent repetition of them. The common fault
in this case, is that of growing too intimate, and falling
into displeasing familiarities: for it is a very ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>thing for men to make no other use of a close acquaintance
with each other's affairs, but to tease one another
with unacceptable allusions. One would pass over
patiently such as converse like animals, and salute each
other with bangs on the shoulder, sly raps with canes,
or other robust pleasantries practised by the rural gentry
of this nation: but even among those who should have
more polite ideas of things, you see a set of people who
invert the design of conversation, and make frequent
mention of ungrateful subjects; nay, mention them because
they are ungrateful; as if the perfection of society
were in knowing how to offend on the one part, and how
to bear an offence on the other. In all parts of this
populous town you find the merry world made up of
an active and a passive companion; one who has good-nature
enough to suffer all his friend shall think fit to
say, and one who is resolved to make the most of his
good-humour to show his parts. In the trading part of
mankind, I have ever observed the jest went by the
weight of purses, and the ridicule is made up by the
gains which arise from it. Thus the packer allows the
clothier to say what he pleases, and the broker has his
countenance ready to laugh with the merchant, though
the abuse is to fall on himself, because he knows that, as
a go-between, he shall find his account in being in the
good graces of a man of wealth. Among these just and
punctual people, the richest man is ever the better jester;
and they know no such thing as a person who shall pretend
to a superior laugh at a man, who does not make
him amends by opportunities of advantage in another
kind: but among people of a different way, where the
pretended distinction in company is only what is raised
from sense and understanding, it is very absurd to carry
on a rough raillery so far, as that the whole discourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
should turn upon each other's infirmities, follies, or
misfortunes.</p>

<p>I was this evening with a set of wags of this class.
They appear generally by two and two; and what is
most extraordinary, is, that those very persons who are
most together, appear least of a mind when joined by
other company. This evil proceeds from an indiscreet
familiarity, whereby a man is allowed to say the most
grating thing imaginable to another, and it shall be
accounted weakness to show an impatience for the unkindness.
But this and all other deviations from the
design of pleasing each other when we meet, are derived
from interlopers in society, who want capacity to put in
a stock among regular companions, and therefore supply
their wants by stale histories, sly observations, and rude
hints, which relate to the conduct of others. All cohabitants
in general run into this unhappy fault; men and
their wives break into reflections which are like so much
Arabic to the rest of the company; sisters and brothers
often make the like figure from the same unjust sense of
the art of being intimate and familiar. It is often said,
such a one cannot stand the mention of such a circumstance:
if he cannot, I am sure it is for want of discourse,
or a worse reason, that any companion of his touches
upon it.</p>

<p>Familiarity, among the truly well-bred, never gives
authority to trespass upon one another in the most
minute circumstance, but it allows to be kinder than
we ought otherwise presume to be. Eusebius has wit,
humour, and spirit; but there never was a man in his
company who wished he had less, for he understands
familiarity so well, that he knows how to make use of it
in a way that neither makes himself or his friend contemptible;
but if any one is lessened by his freedom, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
he himself, who always likes the place, the diet, and the
reception, when he is in the company of his friends.
Equality is the life of conversation; and he is as much
out who assumes to himself any part above another, as
he who considers himself below the rest of the society.
Familiarity in inferiors is sauciness; in superiors, condescension;
neither of which are to have being among
companions, the very word implying that they are to be
equal. When therefore we have abstracted the company
from all considerations of their quality or fortune, it will
immediately appear, that to make it happy and polite,
there must nothing be started which shall discover that
our thoughts run upon any such distinctions. Hence it
will arise, that benevolence must become the rule of
society, and he that is most obliging must be most
diverting.</p>

<p>This way of talking I am fallen into from the reflection
that I am wherever I go entertained with some
absurdity, mistake, weakness, or ill luck of some man or
other, whom not only I, but the person who makes me
those relations has a value for. It would therefore be a
great benefit to the world, if it could be brought to pass
that no story should be a taking one, but what was to the
advantage of the person of whom it is related. By this
means, he that is now a wit in conversation, would be
considered as a spreader of false news is in business.</p>

<p>But above all, to make a familiar fit for a bosom
friend, it is absolutely necessary that we should always
be inclined rather to hide than rally each other's infirmities.
To suffer for a fault is a sort of atonement; and
nobody is concerned for the offence for which he has
made reparation.</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em>&mdash;I have received the following letter, which rallies
me for being witty sooner than I designed; but I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>

<h3><em>St. James's Coffee-house, Sept. 15.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Advices from Madrid of the 8th say, the Duke of
Anjou, with his Court, and all the Councils, were
preparing to leave that place in a day or two, in order to
remove to Valladolid. They add, that the palace was
already unfurnished, and a declaration had been published,
importing, that it was absolutely necessary, in the present
conjuncture of affairs, that the Court were absent for
some time from Madrid, but would return thither in six
weeks. This sudden departure is attributed to the advice
that the Portuguese army was in motion to enter Spain
by Braganza, and that his Catholic Majesty was on the
march with a strong detachment towards Castille. Two
thousand horse were arrived at Agreda, and it is reported
they were to join the rest of the body, with the King,
and advance to Calatayud, on their way to Madrid, whilst
General Staremberg observed the enemy on the frontier
of Navarre. They write from Bayonne, that the Duke
of Vend&ocirc;me set forwards to Spain on the 14th.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Sept. 18.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is one of the designs of this paper to transmit to
posterity an account of everything that is monstrous
in my own times. For this reason I shall here publish
to the world the life of a person who was neither man
nor woman, as written by one of my ingenious correspondents,
who seems to have imitated Plutarch in that
multifarious erudition, and those occasional dissertations,
which he has wrought into the body of his history. The
Life I am putting out, is that of Margery, <em>alias</em> John
Young, commonly known by the name of Dr. Young,
who (as the town very well knows) was a woman that
practised physic in man's clothes, and after having had two
wives and several children, died about a month since.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I here make bold to trouble you with a short account
of the famous Dr. Young's life, which you may call
(if you please) a second part of the farce of the 'Sham
Doctor.' This perhaps will not seem so strange to you,
who (if I am not mistaken) have somewhere mentioned
with honour your sister Kirleus<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> as a practitioner both in

a she-quack is altogether as strange and astonishing

the great founder of your art, was particularly
famous for his beard, as we may conclude from the
behaviour of a tyrant who is branded by heathen historians
as guilty both of sacrilege and blasphemy, having
robbed the statue of &AElig;sculapius of a thick bushy golden
beard, and then alleged for his excuse, that it was a shame
the son should have a beard when his father Apollo had
none. This latter instance indeed seems something to
favour a female professor, since (as I have been told) the
ancient statues of Apollo are generally made with the
head and face of a woman: nay, I have been credibly
informed by those who have seen them both, that the
famous Apollo in the Belvedere did very much resemble
Dr. Young. Let that be as it will, the doctor was a
kind of Amazon in physic, that made as great devastations
and slaughters as any of our chief heroes in the art,
and was as fatal to the English in these our days, as the
famous Joan d'Arc was in those of our forefathers.</p>

<p>"I do not find anything remarkable in the Life I am
about to write till the year 1695, at which time the
doctor, being about twenty-three years old, was brought
to bed of a bastard child. The scandal of such a misfortune
gave so great uneasiness to pretty Mrs. Peggy
(for that was the name by which the doctor was then
called), that she left her family, and followed her lover
to London, with a fixed resolution some way or other to
recover her lost reputation: but instead of changing her
life, which one would have expected from so good a disposition
of mind, she took it in her head to change her
sex. This was soon done by the help of a sword and a
pair of breeches. I have reason to believe, that her first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
design was to turn man-midwife, having herself had some
experience in those affairs: but thinking this too narrow
a foundation for her future fortune, she at length bought
her a gold button coat, and set up for a physician. Thus
we see the same fatal miscarriage in her youth made Mrs.
Young a doctor, that formerly made one of the same sex
a Pope.</p>

<p>"The doctor succeeded very well in his business at
first, but very often met with accidents that disquieted
him. As he wanted that deep magisterial voice which
gives authority to a prescription, and is absolutely necessary
for the right pronouncing of those words, 'Take
these pills,' he unfortunately got the nickname of the
Squeaking Doctor. If this circumstance alarmed the
doctor, there was another that gave him no small disquiet,
and very much diminished his gains. In short, he
found himself run down as a superficial prating quack
in all families that had at the head of them a cautious
father or a jealous husband. These would often complain
among one another, that they did not like such a
smock-faced physician; though in truth had they known
how justly he deserved that name, they would rather
have favoured his practice than have apprehended anything
from it.</p>

<p>"Such were the motives that determined Mrs. Young
to change her condition, and take in marriage a virtuous
young woman, who lived with her in good reputation,
and made her the father of a very pretty girl. But this
part of her happiness was soon after destroyed by a distemper
which was too hard for our physician, and carried
off his first wife. The doctor had not been a widow
long before he married his second lady, with whom also
he lived in very good understanding. It so happened
that the doctor was with child at the same time that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
lady was; but the little ones coming both together, they
passed for twins. The doctor having entirely established
the reputation of his manhood, especially by the birth of
the boy of whom he had been lately delivered, and who
very much resembles him, grew into good business, and
was particularly famous for the cure of venereal distempers;
but would have had much more practice among
his own sex, had not some of them been so unreasonable
as to demand certain proofs of their cure, which the
doctor was not able to give them. The florid blooming
look, which gave the doctor some uneasiness at first,
instead of betraying his person, only recommended his
physic. Upon this occasion I cannot forbear mentioning
what I thought a very agreeable surprise in one of
Moli&egrave;re's plays, where a young woman applies herself to
a sick person in the habit of a quack, and speaks to her
patient, who was something scandalised at the youth of
his physician, to the following purpose: 'I began to
practise in the reign of Francis I., and am now in the
hundred-and-fiftieth year of my age; but, by the virtue
of my medicaments, have maintained myself in the same
beauty and freshness I had at fifteen.' For this reason
Hippocrates lays it down as a rule, that a student in
physic should have a sound constitution and a healthy
look, which indeed seem as necessary qualifications for
a physician as a good life and virtuous behaviour for a
divine. But to return to our subject. About two years
ago the doctor was very much afflicted with the vapours,
which grew upon him to such a degree, that about six
weeks since they made an end of him. His death discovered
the disguise he had acted under, and brought
him back again to his former sex. 'Tis said, that at his
burial the pall was held up by six women of some fashion.
The doctor left behind him a widow and two fatherless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
children, if they may be called so, besides the little boy
before mentioned; in relation to whom we may say of
the doctor, as the good old ballad about the 'Children in
the Wood' says of the unnatural uncle, that he was father
and mother both in one. These are all the circumstances
that I could learn of Dr. Young's life, which might have
given occasion to many obscene fictions: but as I know
those would never have gained a place in your paper, I
have not troubled you with any impertinence of that
nature; having stuck to the truth very scrupulously, as I
always do when I subscribe myself,</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Sept. 20.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is the business of reason and philosophy to soothe
and allay the passions of the mind, or turn them to a
vigorous prosecution of what is dictated by the understanding.
In order to this good end, I would keep a
watchful eye upon the growing inclinations of youth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>and be particularly careful to prevent their indulging
themselves in such sentiments as may embitter their more
advanced age. I have now under cure a young gentleman,
who lately communicated to me, that he was of all
men living the most miserably envious. I desired the
circumstances of his distemper; upon which, with a sigh
that would have moved the most inhuman breast: "Mr.
Bickerstaff," said he, "I am nephew to a gentleman of
a very great estate, to whose favour I have a cousin that
has equal pretensions with myself. This kinsman of
mine is a young man of the highest merit imaginable,
and has a mind so tender and so generous, that I can
observe he returns my envy with pity. He makes me
upon all occasions the most obliging condescensions: and
I cannot but take notice of the concern he is in to see
my life blasted with this racking passion, though it is
against himself. In the presence of my uncle, when I
am in the room, he never speaks so well as he is capable
of, but always lowers his talents and accomplishments
out of regard to me. What I beg of you, dear sir, is
to instruct me how to love him, as I know he does me;
and I beseech you, if possible, to set my heart right,
that it may no longer be tormented where it should be
pleased, or hate a man whom I cannot but approve."</p>

<p>The patient gave me this account with such candour
and openness, that I conceived immediate hopes of his
cure; because in diseases of the mind the person affected
is half recovered when he is sensible of his distemper.
"Sir," said I, "the acknowledgment of your kinsman's
merit is a very hopeful symptom; for it is the nature of
persons afflicted with this evil, when they are incurable,
to pretend a contempt of the person envied, if they are
taxed with that weakness. A man who is really envious
will not allow he is so; but upon such an accusation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
tormented with the reflection, that to envy a man is to
allow him your superior. But in your case, when you
examine the bottom of your heart, I am apt to think it is
avarice which you mistake for envy. Were it not that
you have both expectations from the same man, you would
look upon your cousin's accomplishments with pleasure.
You that now consider him as an obstacle to your interest,
would then behold him as an ornament to your family."
I observed my patient upon this occasion recover himself
in some measure; and he owned to me, that he hoped
it was as I imagined; for that in all places but where he
was his rival, he had pleasure in his company. This was
the first discourse we had upon this malady; and I do
not doubt but, after two or three more, I shall by just
degrees soften his envy into emulation.</p>

<p>Such an envy as I have here described may possibly creep
into an ingenuous mind; but the envy which makes a
man uneasy to himself and others, is a certain distortion
and perverseness of temper, that renders him unwilling
to be pleased with anything without him that has either
beauty or perfection in it. I look upon it as a distemper
in the mind (which I know no moralist that has described
in this light), when a man cannot discern anything which
another is master of that is agreeable. For which reason
I look upon the good-natured man to be endowed with
a certain discerning faculty which the envious are altogether
deprived of. Shallow wits, superficial critics, and
conceited fops are with me so many blind men in respect
of excellences. They can behold nothing but faults
and blemishes, and indeed see nothing that is worth
seeing. Show them a poem, it is stuff; a picture, it is
daubing. They find nothing in architecture that is not
irregular, or in music that is not out of tune. These
men should consider, that it is their envy which deforms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
everything, and that the ugliness is not in the object,
but in the eye. And as for nobler minds, whose merits
are either not discovered, or are misrepresented by the
envious part of mankind, they should rather consider
their defamers with pity than indignation. A man cannot
have an idea of perfection in another which he was
never sensible of in himself. Mr. Locke tells us, that
upon asking a blind man, what he thought scarlet was,
he answered, that he believed it was like the sound of
a trumpet. He was forced to form his conceptions of
ideas which he had not by those which he had. In the
same manner, ask an envious man, what he thinks of
virtue? he will call it design: what of good-nature? and
he will term it dulness. The difference is, that as the
person before mentioned was born blind, your envious
men have contracted the distemper themselves, and are
troubled with a sort of an acquired blindness. Thus the
devil in Milton, though made an angel of light, could
see nothing to please him even in Paradise, and hated
our first parents, though in their state of innocence.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I have long been of the number of your admirers,
and take this opportunity of telling you so. I
know not why a man so famed for astrological observations
may not be also a good casuist, upon which presumption
'tis I ask your advice in an affair that at present
puzzles quite that slender stock of divinity I am master
of. I have now been some time in holy orders, and
fellow of a certain college in one of the universities; but
weary of that inactive life, I resolve to be doing good in
my generation. A worthy gentleman has lately offered
me a fat rectory, but means, I perceive, his kinswoman
should have the benefit of the clergy. I am a novice
in the world, and confess, it startles me how the body
of Mrs. Abigail can be annexed to cure of souls. Sir,
would you give us in one of your <cite>Tatlers</cite> the original

the laws are silent, men's consciences ought to be so
too; you could not more oblige our fraternity of young

why our clergy, who are very frequently men of good

espouse a handmaid with a rectory <i lang="la">in commendam</i>, since
the best of our peers have often joined themselves to the

<p class="drop-cap">The whole creation preys upon itself: every living
creature is inhabited. A flea has a thousand invisible
insects that tease him as he jumps from place
to place, and revenge our quarrels upon him. A very
ordinary microscope shows us that a louse is itself a
very lousy creature. A whale, besides those seas and
oceans in the several vessels of his body, which are
filled with innumerable shoals of little animals, carries
about it a whole world of inhabitants; insomuch that,
if we believe the calculations some have made, there
are more living creatures which are too small for the
naked eye to behold about the leviathan, than there
are of visible creatures upon the face of the whole earth.
Thus every nobler creature is as it were the basis and
support of multitudes that are his inferiors.</p>

to that quarter.</p>

<p>They say, when a fox is very much troubled with
fleas, he goes into the next pool with a little lock of
wool in his mouth, and keeps his body under water till
the vermin get into it, after which he quits the wool,
and diving, leaves his tormentors to shift for themselves,
and get their livelihood where they can. I would have
these gentlemen take care that I do not serve them after
the same manner; for though I have hitherto kept my
temper pretty well, it is not impossible but I may some
time or other disappear; and what will then become of
them? Should I lay down my paper, what a famine
would there be among the hawkers, printers, booksellers,
and authors? It would be like Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;'s<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> dropping
his cloak, with the whole congregation hanging upon
the skirts of it. To enumerate some of these my
doughty antagonists, I was threatened to be answered
weekly <cite>Tit for Tat</cite>: I was undermined by the <cite>Whisperer</cite>,
haunted by <cite>Tom Brown's Ghost</cite>, scolded at by a <cite>Female</cite>
<cite>Tatler</cite>, and slandered by another of the same character,
under the title of <cite>Atalantis</cite>. I have been <em>annotated</em>,
<em>re-tattled</em>, <em>examined</em>, and <em>condoled</em>;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> but it being my stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>ing
maxim never to speak ill of the dead, I shall let
these authors rest in peace, and take great pleasure in
thinking that I have sometimes been the means of their
getting a bellyful. When I see myself thus surrounded
by such formidable enemies, I often think of the Knight
of the Red Cross in Spenser's "Den of Error," who after
he has cut off the dragon's head, and left it wallowing in
a flood of ink, sees a thousand monstrous reptiles making
their attempts upon him, one with many heads, another
with none, and all of them without eyes.</p>

<p>If ever I should want such a fry of little authors to
attend me, I shall think my paper in a very decaying
condition. They are like ivy about an oak, which
adorns the tree at the same time that it eats into it; or
like a great man's equipage, that do honour to the person
on whom they feed. For my part, when I see myself
thus attacked, I do not consider my antagonists as
malicious, but hungry, and therefore am resolved never
to take any notice of them.</p>

<p>As for those who detract from my labours without
being prompted to it by an empty stomach, in return
to their censures I shall take pains to excel, and never
fail to persuade myself, that their enmity is nothing
but their envy or ignorance.</p>

<p>Give me leave to conclude, like an old man and a
moralist, with a fable:</p>

<p>The owls, bats, and several other birds of night, were
one day got together in a thick shade, where they abused
their neighbours in a very sociable manner. Their satire
at last fell upon the sun, whom they all agreed to be
very troublesome, impertinent, and inquisitive. Upon
which the sun, who overheard them, spoke to them
after this manner: "Gentlemen, I wonder how you
dare abuse one that you know could in an instant scorch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
you up, and burn every mother's son of you: but the
only answer I shall give you, or the revenge I shall take

Jo. Partridge, Esq., on March 2, 1710, with an announcement of
Bickerstaff's death; probably it reached only to five numbers. Of
the <cite>Whisperer</cite> (October 11, 1709), and the <cite>Gazette &agrave;-la-Mode, or Tom
Brown's Ghost</cite> (May 12, 1709), only single numbers are known. The
<cite>Female Tatler</cite>, issued by Thomas Baker, lasted from July 8, 1709, to
March 31, 1710; and there was a rival paper, with the same title,
printed for A Baldwin. The "New Atalantis," Mrs. Manley's well-known
book, contained more than one attack on Steele. "Annotated"
refers to the satirical "Annotations upon the <cite>Tatler</cite>," 1710
(see No. 224); and "condoled," to a pamphlet, "A Condoling Letter
to the <cite>Tatler</cite>; on account of the misfortunes of Isaac Bickerstaff, a
prisoner in the &mdash;&mdash; on suspicion of debt" (September 19, 1710).
The Tory <cite>Examiner</cite> had much to say about the <cite>Tatler</cite> and Steele's
subsequent writings. Nothing is known of a <cite>Re-Tatler</cite>.
</p>
<p>
"For my part," wrote Defoe, "I have always thought that the
weakest step the Tatler ever took, if that complete author can be
said to have done anything weak, was to stoop to take the least
notice of the barkings of the animals that have condoled him,
examined him, &amp;c. He should have let every bark and fool rail,
and, according to his own observation of the fable of the sun,
continued to shine on. This I have found to be agreeable to the
true notion of contempt. Silence is the utmost slight nature can
dictate to a man, and the most insupportable for a vain man to
bear."</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The following letter has laid before me many great
and manifest evils in the world of letters which
I had overlooked; but they open to me a very busy
scene, and it will require no small care and application
to amend errors which are become so universal. The
affectation of politeness is exposed in this epistle with
a great deal of wit and discernment; so that whatever
discourses I may fall into hereafter upon the subjects
the writer treats of, I shall at present lay the matter
before the world without the least alteration from the
words of my correspondent.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p class="center">To <span class="smcap">Isaac Bickerstaff</span>, Esq.
</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"There are some abuses among us of great consequence,
the reformation of which is properly
your province; though as far as I have been conversant
in your papers, you have not yet considered them.
These are the deplorable ignorance that for some years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>hath reigned among our English writers, the great depravity
of our taste, and the continual corruption of our
style. I say nothing here of those who handle particular
sciences, divinity, law, physic, and the like; I mean the
traders in history and politics, and the <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i>; together
with those by whom books are not translated, but
(as the common expressions are) done out of French,
Latin, or other language, and made English. I cannot
but observe to you, that till of late years a Grub Street
book was always bound in sheepskin, with suitable print
and paper, the price never above a shilling, and taken off
wholly by common tradesmen or country pedlars; but
now they appear in all sizes and shapes, and in all places.
They are handed about from lapfuls in every coffee-house
to persons of quality; are shown in Westminster Hall
and the Court of Requests. You may see them gilt and
in royal paper of five or six hundred pages, and rated
accordingly. I would engage to furnish you with a catalogue
of English books published within the compass of
seven years past, which at the first hand would cost you a
hundred pounds, wherein you shall not be able to find ten
lines together of common grammar or common sense.</p>

<p>"These two evils, ignorance and want of taste, have
produced a third; I mean the continual corruption of
our English tongue, which, without some timely remedy,
will suffer more by the false refinements of twenty years
past than it hath been improved in the foregoing hundred.
And this is what I design chiefly to enlarge upon,
leaving the former evils to your animadversion.</p>

<p>"But instead of giving you a list of the late refinements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>crept into our language, I here send you the copy of a
letter I received some time ago from a most accomplished
person in this way of writing; upon which I shall make
some remarks. It is in these terms:</p>

<p>
"'<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"'I <em>cou'dn't</em> get the things you sent for all <em>about town</em>.
I <em>th&ocirc;t</em> to <em>ha'</em> come down myself, and then <em>I'd h'</em>
<em>b&ocirc;t 'um</em>; but I <em>ha'n't don't</em>, and I believe I <em>can't d't,</em>
<em>that's pozz</em>. Tom<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> begins to <em>gi'mself</em> airs, because <em>he's</em>
going with the <em>plenipo's</em>. 'Tis said the French King
will <em>bamboozl' us agen</em>, which <em>causes many speculations</em>.
The Jacks and others of that <em>kidney</em> are very <em>uppish</em>, and
<em>alert upon't</em>, as you may see by their <em>phizz's</em>. Will
Hazzard has got the <em>hipps</em>, having lost <em>to the tune of</em>
five hundr'd pound, <em>th&ocirc;</em> he understands play very well,
<em>nobody better</em>. He has promis't me upon <em>rep</em>, to leave
off play; but you know 'tis a weakness <em>he's</em> too apt to
<em>give into, th&ocirc;</em> he has as much wit as any man, <em>nobody</em>
<em>more</em>. He has lain <em>incog.</em> ever since. The <em>mobb's</em> very
quiet with us now. I believe you <em>th&ocirc;t</em> I <em>bantr'd</em> you in
my last like a <em>country put</em>. I <em>shan't</em> leave town this
month,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>"This letter is in every point an admirable pattern of
the present polite way of writing, nor is it of less authority
for being an epistle: you may gather every flower in
it, with a thousand more of equal sweetness, from the
books, pamphlets, and single papers, offered us every day
in the coffee-houses: and these are the beauties introduced
to supply the want of wit, sense, humour, and
learning, which formerly were looked upon as qualifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
for a writer. If a man of wit, who died forty years
ago, were to rise from the grave on purpose, how would
he be able to read this letter? And after he had got
through that difficulty, how would he be able to understand
it? The first thing that strikes your eye is the
breaks at the end of almost every sentence, of which I
know not the use, only that it is a refinement, and
very frequently practised. Then you will observe the
abbreviations and elisions, by which consonants of most
obdurate sound are joined together, without one softening
vowel to intervene; and all this only to make one
syllable of two, directly contrary to the example of the
Greeks and Romans, altogether of the Gothic strain, and
a natural tendency towards relapsing into barbarity,
which delights in monosyllables, and uniting of mute
consonants, as it is observable in all the Northern languages.
And this is still more visible in the next refinement,
which consists in pronouncing the first syllable in
a word that has many, and dismissing the rest; such as
phizz, hipps, mobb, pozz, rep, and many more, when we
are already overloaded with monosyllables, which are the
disgrace of our language. Thus we cram one syllable,
and cut off the rest, as the owl fattened her mice after
she had bit off their legs, to prevent them from running
away; and if ours be the same reason for maiming our
words, it will certainly answer the end, for I am sure no
other nation will desire to borrow them. Some words
are hitherto but fairly split, and therefore only in their
way to perfection, as incog. and plenipo; but in a short
time, 'tis to be hoped, they will be further docked to
inc. and plen. This reflection has made me of late years
very impatient for a peace, which I believe would save
the lives of many brave words, as well as men. The
war has introduced abundance of polysyllables, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
will never be able to live many more campaigns. Speculations,
operations, preliminaries, ambassadors, palisadoes,
communication, circumvallation, battalions, as numerous
as they are, if they attack us too frequently in our coffee-houses,
we shall certainly put them to flight, and cut off
the rear.</p>

<p>"The third refinement observable in the letter I send
you, consists in the choice of certain words invented by
some pretty fellows, such as banter, bamboozle, country
put, and kidney, as it is there applied, some of which
are now struggling for the vogue, and others are in possession
of it. I have done my utmost for some years
past to stop the progress of mobb and banter, but have
been plainly borne down by numbers, and betrayed by
those who promised to assist me.</p>

<p>"In the last place, you are to take notice of certain
choice phrases scattered through the letter, some of them
tolerable enough, till they were worn to rags by servile
imitators. You might easily find them, though they
were not in a different print, and therefore I need not
disturb them.</p>

<p>"These are the false refinements in our style which you
ought to correct: first, by argument and fair means; but
if those fail, I think you are to make use of your authority
as censor, and by an annual 'Index Expurgatorius'
expunge all words and phrases that are offensive to good
sense, and condemn those barbarous mutilations of vowels
and syllables. In this last point the usual pretence is,
that they spell as they speak: a noble standard for language!
To depend upon the caprice of every coxcomb,
who, because words are the clothing of our thoughts, cuts
them out and shapes them as he pleases, and changes
them oftener than his dress. I believe all reasonable
people would be content that such refiners were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
sparing in their words and liberal in their syllables: and
upon this head I should be glad you would bestow some
advice upon several young readers in our churches, who
coming up from the university full fraught with admiration
of our town politeness, will needs correct the style
of their prayer-books. In reading the Absolution, they
are very careful to say 'pardons' and 'absolves'; and in the
prayer for the royal family it must be 'endue 'um, enrich
'um, prosper 'um, and bring 'um.' Then in their sermons
they use all the modern terms of art: sham, banter,
mob, bubble, bully, cutting, shuffling, and palming; all
which, and many more of the like stamp, as I have heard
them often in the pulpit from such young sophisters, so
I have read them in some of those sermons that have
made most noise of late. The design, it seems, is to
avoid the dreadful imputation of pedantry; to show us
that they know the town, understand men and manners,
and have not been poring upon old unfashionable books
in the university.</p>

<p>"I should be glad to see you the instrument of introducing
into our style that simplicity which is the best
and truest ornament of most things in life, which the
politer ages always aimed at in their building and dress
(<i lang="la">simplex munditiis</i>), as well as their productions of wit.
It is manifest, that all new affected modes of speech,
whether borrowed from the court, the town, or the
theatre, are the first perishing parts in any language;
and, as I could prove by many hundred instances, have
been so in ours. The writings of Hooker, who was a
country clergyman, and of Parsons the Jesuit, both in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, are in a style that, with
very few allowances, would not offend any present
reader; much more clear and intelligible than those of
Sir H. Wootton, Sir Rob. Naunton, Osborn, Daniel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
historian, and several others who wrote later; but being
men of the court, and affecting the phrases then in
fashion, they are often either not to be understood, or
appear perfectly ridiculous.</p>

<p>"What remedies are to be applied to these evils, I
have not room to consider, having, I fear, already taken
up most of your paper. Besides, I think it is our office
only to represent abuses, and yours to redress them.
I am with great respect,</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Sept. 29.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There are very many ill habits that might with much
ease have been prevented, which, after we have
indulged ourselves in them, become incorrigible. We
have a sort of proverbial expression, of taking a woman
down in her wedding shoes, if you would bring her
to reason. An early behaviour of this sort had a very
remarkable good effect in a family wherein I was several
years an intimate acquaintance.</p>

<p>A gentleman in Lincolnshire<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> had four daughters,
three of which were early married very happily; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>fourth, though no way inferior to any of her sisters,
either in person or accomplishments, had from her infancy
discovered so imperious a temper (usually called
a high spirit), that it continually made great uneasiness
in the family, became her known character in the
neighbourhood, and deterred all her lovers from declaring
themselves. However, in process of time, a gentleman
of a plentiful fortune and long acquaintance, having
observed that quickness of spirit to be her only fault,
made his addresses, and obtained her consent in due
form. The lawyers finished the writings (in which, by
the way, there was no pin-money), and they were married.
After a decent time spent in the father's house, the
bridegroom went to prepare his seat for her reception.
During the whole course of his courtship, though a
man of the most equal temper, he had artificially
lamented to her, that he was the most passionate creature
breathing. By this one intimation, he at once made her
understand warmth of temper to be what he ought to
pardon in her, as well as that he alarmed her against
that constitution in himself. She at the same time
thought herself highly obliged by the composed behaviour
which he maintained in her presence. Thus
far he with great success soothed her from being guilty
of violences, and still resolved to give her such a terrible
apprehension of his fiery spirit, that she should never
dream of giving way to her own. He returned on the
day appointed for carrying her home; but instead of a
coach and six horses, together with the gay equipage
suitable to the occasion, he appeared without a servant,
mounted on the skeleton of a horse which his huntsman
had the day before brought in to feast his dogs on the
arrival of their new mistress, with a pillion fixed behind,
and a case of pistols before him, attended only by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
favourite hound. Thus equipped, he in a very obliging
(but somewhat positive) manner desired his lady to seat
herself on the cushion; which done, away they crawled.
The road being obstructed by a gate, the dog was
commanded to open it: the poor cur looked up and
wagged his tail; but the master, to show the impatience
of his temper, drew a pistol and shot him dead. He
had no sooner done it, but he fell into a thousand
apologies for his unhappy rashness, and begged as many
pardons for his excesses before one for whom he had so
profound a respect. Soon after their steed stumbled,
but with some difficulty recovered: however, the bridegroom
took occasion to swear, if he frightened his wife
so again, he would run him through: and alas! the
poor animal being now almost tired, made a second trip;
immediately on which the careful husband alights, and
with great ceremony first takes off his lady, then the
accoutrements, draws his sword, and saves the huntsman
the trouble of killing him: then says to his wife, "Child,
prithee take up the saddle;" which she readily did, and
tugged it home, where they found all things in the
greatest order, suitable to their fortune and the present
occasion. Some time after the father of the lady gave
an entertainment to all his daughters and their husbands,
where, when the wives were retired, and the gentlemen
passing a toast about, our last married man took occasion
to observe to the rest of his brethren, how much,
to his great satisfaction, he found the world mistaken
as to the temper of his lady, for that she was the most
meek and humble woman breathing. The applause
was received with a loud laugh: but as a trial which

proposed they should all by turns send for their wives
down to them. A servant was despatched, and answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
was made by one, "Tell him I will come by-and-by;"
another, that she would come when the cards were
out of her hand; and so on. But no sooner was her
husband's desire whispered in the ear of our last married
lady, but the cards were clapped on the table, and down
she comes with, "My dear, would you speak with me?"
He receives her in his arms, and after repeated caresses,
tells her the experiment, confesses his good-nature, and
assures her, that since she could now command her
temper, he would no longer disguise his own.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Oct. 2.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have received the following letter from my unfortunate
old acquaintance the upholsterer,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> who, I observed,
had long absented himself from the bench at the
upper end of the Mall. Having not seen him for some
time, I was in fear I should soon hear of his death,
especially since he never appeared, though the noons
have been of late pretty warm, and the councils at that
place very full from the hour of twelve to three, which
the sages of that board employ in conference, while the
unthinking part of mankind are eating and drinking for
the support of their own private persons, without any
regard to the public.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I should have waited on you very frequently to have
discoursed you upon some matters of moment, but
that I love to be well informed in the subject upon which
I consult my friends before I enter into debate with
them. I have therefore with the utmost care and pains
applied myself to the reading all the writings and pamphlets
which have come out since the trial,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and have
studied night and day in order to be master of the whole
controversy; but the authors are so numerous, and the
state of affairs alters so very fast, that I am now a fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>night
behindhand in my reading, and know only how
things stood twelve days ago. I wish you would enter
into those useful subjects; for, if I may be allowed to
say so, these are not times to jest in. As for my own
part, you know very well, that I am of a public spirit,
and never regarded my own interest, but looked further;
and let me tell you, that while some people are minding
only themselves and families, and others are thinking
only of their own country, things go on strangely in the
North. I foresee very great evils arising from the neglect
of transactions at a distance; for which reason I am now
writing a letter to a friend in the country, which I design
as an answer to the Czar of Muscovy's letter to the Grand
Signior concerning his Majesty of Sweden. I have endeavoured
to prove that it is not reasonable to expect
that his Swedish Majesty should leave Bender without
forty thousand men; and I have added to this an apology
for the Cossacks. But the matter multiplies upon me,
and I grow dim with much writing; therefore desire,
if you have an old green pair of spectacles, such as you
used about your fiftieth year, that you send them to me;
as also, that you would please to desire Mr. Morphew to
send me in a bushel of coals on the credit of my answer
to his Czarian Majesty; for I design it shall be printed
for Morphew, and the weather grows sharp. I shall
take it kindly if you would order him also to send me
the papers as they come out. If there are no fresh
pamphlets published, I compute that I shall know before
the end of next month what has been done in town to
this day. If it were not for an ill custom lately introduced
by a certain author, of talking Latin at the beginning
of papers, matters would be in a much clearer light
than they are; but to our comfort, there are solid writers
who are not guilty of this pedantry. The <cite>Post-Man</cite> writes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
like an angel: the <cite>Moderator</cite><a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> is fine reading! It would
do you no harm to read the <cite>Post-Boy</cite> with attention; he
is very deep of late. He is instructive; but I confess a
little satirical: a sharp pen! He cares not what he says.
The <cite>Examiner</cite> is admirable, and is become a grave and
substantial author. But above all, I am at a loss how
to govern myself in my judgment of those whose whole
writings consist in interrogatories: and then the way of
answering, by proposing questions as hard to them, is
quite as extraordinary. As for my part, I tremble at
these novelties; we expose, in my opinion, our affairs
too much by it. You may be sure the French King will
spare no cost to come at the reading of them. I dread
to think if the fable of the Blackbirds should fall into
his hands. But I shall not venture to say more till I see
you. In the meantime,</p>

<p class="right">"I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"<em>P.S.</em>&mdash;I take the Bender letter in the <cite>Examiner</cite> to be
spurious."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>This unhappy correspondent, whose fantastical loyalty
to the King of Sweden has reduced him to this low condition
of reason and fortune, would appear much more
monstrous in his madness, did we not see crowds very
little above his circumstances from the same cause, a
passion to politics.</p>

<p>It is no unpleasant entertainment to consider the commerce
even of the sexes interrupted by difference in State
affairs. A wench and her gallant parted last week upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>the words "unlimited" and "passive": and there is such
a jargon of terms got into the mouths of the very silliest
of the women, that you cannot come into a room even
among them, but you find them divided into Whig and
Tory. What heightens the humour is, that all the hard
words they know they certainly suppose to be terms useful
in the disputes of the parties. I came in this day where
two were in very hot debate, and one of them proposed
to me to explain to them what was the difference between
circumcision and predestination. You may be sure I was
at a loss; but they were too angry at each other to wait
for my explanation, but proceeded to lay open the whole
state of affairs, instead of the usual topics of dress, gallantry,
and scandal.</p>

<p>I have often wondered how it should be possible that
this turn to politics should so universally prevail, to the
exclusion of every other subject out of conversation;
and upon mature consideration, find it is for want of
discourse. Look round you among all the young
fellows you meet, and you see those who have least
relish for books, company, or pleasure, though they
have no manner of qualities to make them succeed in
those pursuits, shall make very passable politicians. Thus
the most barren invention shall find enough to say to
make one appear an able man in the top coffee-houses.
It is but adding a certain vehemence in uttering yourself,
let the thing you say be never so flat, and you shall be
thought a very sensible man, if you were not too hot.
As love and honour are the noblest motives of life; so
the pretenders to them, without being animated by them,
are the most contemptible of all sorts of pretenders.
The unjust affectation of anything that is laudable, is
ignominious in proportion to the worth of the thing
we affect: thus, as love of one's country is the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
glorious of all passions, to see the most ordinary tools
in a nation give themselves airs that way, without any
one good quality in their own life, has something in it
romantic, yet not so ridiculous as odious.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Oct. 4.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">When the mind has been perplexed with anxious
cares and passions, the best method of bringing
it to its usual state of tranquillity, is, as much as we
possibly can, to turn our thoughts to the adversities of
persons of higher consideration in virtue and merit than
ourselves. By this means all the little incidents of our
own lives, if they are unfortunate, seem to be the effect
of justice upon our faults and indiscretions. When
those whom we know to be excellent and deserving of
a better fate are wretched, we cannot but resign ourselves,
whom most of us know to merit a much worse
state than that we are placed in. For such and many
other occasions, there is one admirable relation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
one might recommend for certain periods of one's life,
to touch, comfort, and improve the heart of man.
Tully says, somewhere, the pleasures of a husbandman
are next to those of a philosopher. In like manner
one may say (for methinks they bear the same proportion
one to another), the pleasures of humanity are next
to those of devotion. In both these latter satisfactions,
there is a certain humiliation which exalts the soul above
its ordinary state. At the same time that it lessens our
value of ourselves, it enlarges our estimation of others.
The history I am going to speak of, is that of Joseph
in Holy Writ, which is related with such majestic
simplicity, that all the parts of it strike us with strong
touches of nature and compassion, and he must be a
stranger to both who can read it with attention, and not
be overwhelmed with the vicissitudes of joy and sorrow.
I hope it will not be a profanation to tell it one's own
way here, that they who may be unthinking enough to
be more frequently readers of such papers as this than
of Sacred Writ, may be advertised, that the greatest
pleasures the imagination can be entertained with are to
be found there, and that even the style of the Scriptures
is more than human.</p>

<p>Joseph, a beloved child of Israel, became invidious to
his elder brethren, for no other reason but his superior
beauty and excellence of body and mind, insomuch that
they could not bear his growing virtue, and let him live.
They therefore conspire his death; but nature pleaded
so strongly for him in the heart of one of them, that
by his persuasion they determined rather to bury him
in a pit, than be his immediate executioners with their
own hands. When thus much was obtained for him,
their minds still softened towards him, and they took
the opportunity of some passengers to sell him into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Egypt. Israel was persuaded by the artifice of his sons,
that the youth was torn to pieces by wild beasts: but
Joseph was sold to slavery, and still exposed to new
misfortunes, from the same cause as before, his beauty
and his virtue. By a false accusation he was committed
to prison, but in process of time delivered from it, in
consideration of his wisdom and knowledge, and made
the governor of Pharaoh's house. In this elevation of
his fortune, his brothers were sent into Egypt to buy
necessaries of life in a famine. As soon as they are
brought into his presence, he beholds, but he beholds
with compassion, the men who had sold him to slavery
approaching him with awe and reverence. While he
was looking over his brethren, he takes a resolution to
indulge himself in the pleasure of stirring their and
his own affections, by keeping himself concealed, and
examining into the circumstances of their family. For
this end, with an air of severity, as a watchful minister
to Pharaoh, he accuses them as spies, who are come
into Egypt with designs against the State. This led
them into the account which he wanted of them, the
condition of their ancient father and little brother,
whom they had left behind them. When he had
learned that his brother was living, he demands the
bringing him to Egypt, as a proof of their veracity.</p>

<p>But it would be a vain and empty endeavour to
attempt laying this excellent representation of the
passions of man in the same colours as they appear
in the Sacred Writ in any other manner, or almost
any other words, than those made use of in the page
itself. I am obliged therefore to turn my designed
narration rather into a comment upon the several parts
of that beautiful and passionate scene. When Joseph
expects to see Benjamin, how natural and how forcible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
is the reflection, "This affliction is come upon us in that
we saw the anguish of our brother's soul without pity!"
How moving must it be to Joseph to hear Reuben
accuse the rest, that they would not hear what he
pleaded in behalf of his innocence and distress! He
turns from them and weeps, but commands his passion
so far as to give orders for binding one of them in the
presence of the rest, while he at leisure observed their
different sentiments and concern in their gesture and
countenance. When Benjamin is demanded in bondage
for stealing the cup, with what force and what resignation
does Judah address his brother!</p>

<p>"In what words shall I speak to my lord; with what
confidence can I say anything? Our guilt is but too
apparent; we submit to our fate. We are my lord's
servants, both we and he also with whom the cup is
found." When that is not accepted, how pathetically
does he recapitulate the whole story! And approaching
nearer to Joseph, delivers himself as follows; which, if
we fix our thoughts upon the relation between the
pleader and the judge, it is impossible to read without
tears:</p>

<p>"Sir, let me intrude so far upon you, even in the
high condition in which you are, and the miserable one
in which you see me and my brethren, to inform you of
the circumstances of us unhappy men that prostrate ourselves
before you. When we were first examined by you,
you inquired (for what reason my lord inquired we know
not), but you inquired whether we had not a father or a
brother? We then acquainted you, that we had a father,
an old man, who had a child of his old age, and had
buried another son whom he had by the same woman.
You were pleased to command us to bring the child he
had remaining down to us: we did so, and he has for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>feited
his liberty. But my father said to us, 'You know
that my wife bore me two sons: one of them was torn in
pieces: if mischief befall this also, it will bring my grey
hairs with sorrow to the grave. Accept, therefore, oh
my lord! me for your bondman, and let the lad return
with his brethren, that I may not see the evil that shall
come on my father.' Here Joseph's passion grew too
great for further disguise, and he reveals himself with
exclamations of transport and tenderness.</p>

<p>"After their recovery from their first astonishment,
his brethren were seized with fear for the injuries they
had done him; but how generously does he keep them
in countenance, and make an apology for them: 'Be not
angry with yourselves for selling me hither; call it not so,
but think Providence sent me before you to preserve life.'"</p>

<p>It would be endless to go through all the beauties
of this sacred narrative; but any who shall read it, at an
hour when he is disengaged from all other regard or
interests than what arise from it, will feel the alternate
passion of a father, a brother, and a son, so warm in
him, that they will incline him to exert himself (in such
of those characters as happen to be his) much above the
ordinary course of his life.</p>

professed, of being often designedly dull;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and for that

that has so much to struggle with as the man who
pretends to censure others, must keep up his fire for an
onset, and may be allowed to carry his arms a little carelessly
upon an ordinary march. This paper therefore
shall be taken up by my correspondents, two of which
have sent me the two following plain, but sensible and
honest letters, upon subjects no less important than those
of education and devotion:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a><br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I am an old man, retired from all acquaintance with
the town, but what I have from your papers (not
the worst entertainment of my solitude); yet being still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
a well-wisher to my country and the commonwealth of
learning (<i lang="la">a qua, confiteor, nullam &aelig;tatis me&aelig; partem abhorruisse</i>),
and hoping the plain phrase in writing that was
current in my younger days would have lasted for my
time, I was startled at the picture of modern politeness
transmitted by your ingenious correspondent, and
grieved to see our sterling English language fallen into
the hands of clippers and coiners. That mutilated
epistle, consisting of <em>hipps</em>, <em>reps</em>, and such-like enormous
curtailings, was a mortifying spectacle, but with
the reserve of comfort to find this, and other abuses of
our mother-tongue, so pathetically complained of, and
to the proper person for redressing them, the Censor of
Great Britain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"He had before represented the deplorable ignorance
that for several years past has reigned amongst our
English writers, the great depravity of our taste, and
continual corruption of our style: but, sir, before you
give yourself the trouble of prescribing remedies for
these distempers (which you own will require the
greatest care and application), give me leave (having
long had my eye upon these mischiefs, and thoughts
exercised about them) to mention what I humbly conceive
to be the cause of them, and in your friend
Horace's words, "Quo fonte derivata clades In patriam
populumque fluxit."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"I take our corrupt ways of writing to proceed from
the mistakes and wrong measures in our common
methods of education, which I always looked upon as
one of our national grievances, and a singularity that
renders us no less than our situation,</p>

<p class="center"><em>&mdash;&mdash;Penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos.</em><a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
</p>

<p>This puts me upon consulting the most celebrated
critics on that subject, to compare our practice with
their precepts, and find where it was that we came short
or went wide.</p>

<p>"But after all, I found our case required something
more than these doctors had directed, and the principal
defect of our English discipline to lie in the initiatory
part, which, although it needs the greatest care and skill,
is usually left to the conduct of those blind guides, viz.,
Chance and Ignorance.</p>

<p>"I shall trouble you with but a single instance,
pursuant to what your sagacious friend has said, that
he could furnish you with a catalogue of English books,
that would cost you a hundred pounds at first hand,
wherein you could not find ten lines together of
common grammar; which is a necessary consequence
of our mismanagement in that province.</p>

<p>"For can anything be more absurd than our way of
proceeding in this part of literature? To push tender
wits into the intricate mazes of grammar, and a Latin
grammar? To learn an unknown art by an unknown
tongue? To carry them a dark roundabout way to
let them in at a back-door? Whereas by teaching them
first the grammar of their mother-tongue (so easy to
be learned), their advance to the grammars of Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and Greek would be gradual and easy; but our precipitate
way of hurrying them over such a gulf, before we
have built them a bridge to it, is a shock to their weak
understandings, which they seldom, or very late, recover.
In the meantime we wrong nature, and slander infants,
who want neither capacity nor will to learn, till we put
them upon service beyond their strength, and then
indeed we baulk them.</p>

<p>"The liberal arts and sciences are all beautiful as the
Graces, nor has Grammar (the severe mother of all)
so frightful a face of her own; it is the vizard put
upon it that scares children. She is made to speak hard
words that to them sound like conjuring. Let her talk
intelligibly, and they will listen to her.</p>

<p>"In this, I think, as on other accounts, we show
ourselves true Britons, always overlooking our natural
advantages. It has been the practice of wisest nations to
learn their own language by stated rules, to avoid the
confusion that would follow from leaving it to vulgar
use. Our English tongue, says a learned man, is the
most determinate in its construction, and reducible to
the fewest rules: whatever language has less grammar
in it, is not intelligible; and whatever has more, all
that it has more is superfluous; for which reasons he
would have it made the foundation of learning Latin,
and all other languages.</p>

<p>"To speak and write without absurdity the language
of one's country, is commendable in persons of all
stations, and to some indispensably necessary; and to
this purpose, I would recommend above all things the
having a grammar of our mother-tongue first taught
in our schools, which would facilitate our youths
learning their Latin and Greek grammars, with spare
time for arithmetic, astronomy, cosmography, history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
&amp;c., that would make them pass the spring of their life
with profit and pleasure, that is now miserably spent
in grammatical perplexities.</p>

<p>"But here, methinks, I see the reader smile, and
ready to ask me (as the lawyer did sexton Diego on
his bequeathing rich legacies to the poor of the parish,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
Where are these mighty sums to be raised?), Where is
there such a grammar to be had? I will not answer,
as he did, Even where your Worship pleases. No, it is
our good fortune to have such a grammar, with notes,
now in the press, and to be published next term.</p>

<p>"I hear it is a chargeable work, and wish the
publisher to have customers of all that have need of
such a book; yet fancy that he cannot be much a
sufferer, if it is only bought by all that have more need
for it than they think they have.</p>

<p>"A certain author brought a poem to Mr. Cowley,
for his perusal and judgment of the performance, which
he demanded at the next visit with a poetaster's assurance;
and Mr. Cowley, with his usual modesty, desired
that he would be pleased to look a little to the grammar
of it. 'To the grammar of it! What do you mean,
sir? Would you send me to school again?' 'Why, Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash;, would it do you any harm?'</p>

<p>"This put me on considering how this voyage of
literature may be made with more safety and profit,
expedition and delight; and at last, for completing so
good a service, to request your directions in so deplorable
a case; hoping that, as you have had compassion on our

you will exert your charity towards innocents, and

<p><a name="Footnote_129_129" id="Footnote_129_129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_129_129"><span class="label">[129]</span></a> This letter refers to the one by Swift in No. 230, on the corruptions
of the English language in ordinary writings. The present
letter, which is supposed to be by James Greenwood, closes with the
statement that an English grammar, with notes, would be published
next term. Soon afterwards there appeared, with the date 1711, "A
Grammar of the English Tongue, with Notes.... Printed for
John Brightland," &amp;c. This book was noticed in the <cite>Works of the
Learned</cite> for November 1710. Facing the title is a page bearing
the head of Cato the Censor, and the following lines: "The Approbation
of Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.: 'The following treatise being submitted
to my censure, that I may pass it with integrity, I must
declare, that as grammar in general is on all hands allowed to be the
foundation of all arts and sciences, so it appears to me that this
Grammar of the English Tongue has done that justice to our language
which, till now, it never obtained. The text will improve the most
ignorant, and the notes will employ the most learned. I therefore
enjoin all my female correspondents to buy, read, and study this
grammar, that their letters may be something less enigmatic; and
on all my male correspondents likewise, who make no conscience of
false spelling and false English, I lay the same injunction, on pain of
having their epistles exposed in their own proper dress in my Lucubrations.&mdash;Isaac
Bickerstaff, Censor.'" There is a Dedication to the
Queen, and a Preface in which "the Authors" explain how they
have come to undertake a much-needed work at the request of Mr.
Brightland.
</p>
<p>
This book was followed by a pamphlet of six pages, "Reasons for
an English Education, by teaching the Youth of both Sexes the Arts
of Grammar, Rhetoric, Poetry, and Logic, in their own Mother-Tongue,
1711." On p. 5 the writer asks, "Has our Censor complained
without cause, and given a false alarm of danger to the
language of our country? (Lucubrat., Sept. 28, 1710);" and on the
next page we are told that I. B., encouraged by the success of his
book, was industriously correcting it for a second edition. This appeared
in 1712, with an increase in the number of pages from 180 to
264. Other editions appeared in 1714 and 1720. The fifth is dated
1729, and is advertised in the <cite>Craftsman</cite> for July 5, 1729, as "recommended
by Sir Richard Steele, for the use of the schools of
Great Britain;" but according to the <cite>Monthly Chronicle</cite>, it really
appeared on August 8, 1728, being called in the Index, "Bickerstaffe's
Grammar." The seventh and eighth editions were published in 1746
and 1759.
</p>
<p>
In Nos. 254 and 255 of the <cite>Tatler</cite> there was advertised, as shortly
to be published, "An Essay towards a Practical English Grammar, by
James Greenwood.... Particular care has been taken to render this
book useful and agreeable to the Fair Sex." This book is dated 1711,
and is noticed in the <cite>Works of the Learned</cite> for July. The Preface
gives "part of a letter which I wrote about a twelvemonth ago to
the ingenious author of the <cite>Tatler</cite> upon this head" (<em>i.e.</em> knowledge
of grammar among the fair sex). Greenwood's remarks on female
education were not printed in the <cite>Tatler</cite>; but they may have formed
part of the letter in this number (234), if this letter is by Greenwood.
The third edition, enlarged, of Greenwood's "Essay" appeared on
May 24, 1729. Greenwood was sub-master at St. Paul's School, and
afterwards kept a boarding-school at Woodford, in Essex. He published
"The London Vocabulary, English and Latin," of which there
was a third edition in 1713, with curious illustrations. By 1817 this
book had passed through twenty six-editions in England, besides several
in America. Greenwood also published in 1713 "The Virgin Muse,"
a collection of poetry for "young gentlemen and ladies at school."
Second and third editions appeared in 1722 and 1731.
</p>
<p>
Michael Maittaire also issued, in 1712, "An English Grammar; or,
an Essay on the Art of Grammar, applied to and exemplified in the
English Tongue." In the same year a pamphlet appeared with the
title, "Bellum Grammatical, or the Grammatical Battle-Royal. In
Reflections on the three English Grammars published in about a year
last past." It consists chiefly of an attack on Greenwood's "Essay,"
and praise of Brightland's "Grammar," which "merits what the
Censor said of it." In a postscript Maittaire's "Grammar" is described
as the worst of all. Brightland and Greenwood deserve to be
remembered for their efforts to spread abroad a knowledge of "the
genius and nature of the English tongue." (The facts in this note
are taken from a paper by the present writer in <cite>Watford's Antiquarian</cite>
for October 1885.)</p></div>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Oct. 9.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Among those inclinations which are common to all
men, there is none more unaccountable than that
unequal love by which parents distinguish their children
from each other. Sometimes vanity and self-love appear
to have a share towards this effect; and in other instances
I have been apt to attribute it to mere instinct: but
however that is, we frequently see the child that has been
beholden to neither of these impulses in their parents, in
spite of being neglected, snubbed, and thwarted at home,
acquire a behaviour which makes it as agreeable to all
the rest of the world, as that of every one else of their
family is to each other. I fell into this way of thinking
from an intimacy which I have with a very good house
in our neighbourhood, where there are three daughters
of a very different character and genius. The eldest has
a great deal of wit and cunning; the second has good
sense, but no artifice; the third has much vivacity, but
little understanding. The first is a fine, but scornful
woman; the second is not charming, but very winning;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the third no way commendable, but very desirable. The
father of these young creatures was ever a great pretender
to wit, the mother a woman of as much coquetry. This
turn in the parents has biassed their affections towards
their children. The old man supposes the eldest of his
own genius, and the mother looks upon the youngest
as herself renewed. By this means, all the lovers that
approach the house are discarded by the father for not
observing Mrs. Mary's wit and beauty, and by the
mother for being blind to the mien and air of Mrs.
Biddy. Come never so many pretenders, they are not
suspected to have the least thoughts of Mrs. Betty, the
middle daughter. Betty therefore is mortified into a
woman of a great deal of merit, and knows she must
depend on that only for her advancement. The middlemost
is thus the favourite of all her acquaintance as well
as mine, while the other two carry a certain insolence
about them in all conversations, and expect the partiality
which they meet with at home to attend them wherever
they appear. So little do parents understand that they
are of all people the least judges of their children's
merit, that what they reckon such, is seldom anything
else but a repetition of their own faults and infirmities.</p>

<p>There is, methinks, some excuse for being particular
when one of the offspring has any defect in nature. In
this case, the child, if we may so speak, is so much the
longer the child of its parents, and calls for the continuance
of their care and indulgence from the slowness of
its capacity, or the weakness of its body. But there is
no enduring to see men enamoured only at the sight of
their own impertinences repeated, and to observe, as we
may sometimes, that they have a secret dislike of their
children for a degeneracy from their very crimes. Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>mend
me to Lady Goodly; she is equal to all her own
children, but prefers them to those of all the world
beside. My lady is a perfect hen in the care of her
brood; she fights and squabbles with all that appear
where they come, but is wholly unbiassed in dispensing
her favours among them. It is no small pains she is at
to defame all the young women in her neighbourhood
by visits, whispers, intimations, and hearsays; all which
she ends with thanking Heaven, that no one living is
so blessed with such obedient and well-inclined children
as herself. Perhaps, says she, Betty cannot dance like
Mrs. Frontinett, and it is no great matter whether she
does or not; but she comes into a room with a good
grace; though she says it that should not, she looks like
a gentlewoman. Then if Mrs. Rebecca is not so talkative
as the mighty wit Mrs. Clapper, yet she is discreet,
she knows better what she says when she does speak. If
her wit be slow, her tongue never runs before it. This
kind parent lifts up her eyes and hands in congratulation
of her own good fortune, and is maliciously thankful
that none of her girls are like any of her neighbours:
but this preference of her own to all others, is grounded
upon an impulse of nature; while those who like one
before another of their own, are so unpardonably unjust,
that it could hardly be equalled in the children, though
they preferred all the rest of the world to such parents.
It is no unpleasant entertainment to see a ball at a
dancing-school, and observe the joy of relations when
the young ones, for whom they are concerned, are in
motion. You need not be told whom the dancers belong
to: at their first appearance the passion of their
parents are in their faces, and there is always a nod
of approbation stolen at a good step, or a graceful
turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember among all my acquaintance but one man
whom I have thought to live with his children with
equanimity and a good grace. He had three sons and
one daughter, whom he bred with all the care imaginable
in a liberal and ingenuous way.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> I have often heard him
say, he had the weakness to love one much better than
the other, but that he took as much pains to correct
that as any other criminal passion that could arise in his
mind. His method was, to make it the only pretension
in his children to his favour to be kind to each other;
and he would tell them, that he who was the best
brother, he would reckon the best son. This turned
their thoughts into an emulation for the superiority in
kind and tender affection towards each other. The boys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>behaved themselves very early with a manly friendship;
and their sister, instead of the gross familiarities and
impertinent freedoms in behaviour, usual in other houses,
was always treated by them with as much complaisance
as any other young lady of their acquaintance. It was
an unspeakable pleasure to visit or sit at meal in that
family. I have often seen the old man's heart flow at
his eyes with joy upon occasions which would appear
indifferent to such as were strangers to the turn of his
mind; but a very slight accident, wherein he saw his
children's good-will to one another, created in him the
God-like pleasure of loving them, because they loved
each other.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> This great command of himself, in hiding
his first impulse to partiality, at last improved to a
steady justice towards them; and that which at first was
but an expedient to correct his weakness, was afterwards
the measure of his virtue.</p>

<p>The truth of it is, those parents who are interested
in the care of one child more than that of another, no
longer deserve the name of parents, but are in effect
as childish as their children, in having such unreasonable
and ungovernable inclinations. A father of this sort
has degraded himself into one of his own offspring;
for none but a child would take part in the passions
of children.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_134_134" id="Footnote_134_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_134_134"><span class="label">[134]</span></a> Addison's father, Dr. Lancelot Addison, Dean of Lichfield, had
three sons: (1) Joseph; (2) Gulston, who died Governor of Fort-George
in the East Indies; (3) Lancelot, who was entered in Queen's
College, and afterwards became Master of Arts, and Fellow of Magdalen
College in Oxford; and a daughter, Dorothy, first married to
Dr. Sartre, formerly minister of Montpellier, and afterwards Prebendary
of Westminster; and, secondly, to Daniel Combes, Esq.
Swift wrote on October 25, 1710: "I dined to-day with Addison
and Steele, and a sister of Mr. Addison, who is married to one Mons.
Sartre, a Frenchman, prebendary of Westminster, who has a delicious
house and garden; yet I thought it was a sort of monastic life in
those cloisters, and I liked Laracor better. Addison's sister is a sort
of a wit, very like him. I am not fond of her."
</p>
<p>
Addison had two other sisters, who died young. Of his brother
Gulston we read thus in the "Wentworth Papers" (pp. 75-76): "Since
I wrote this, I am told a great piece of news, that Mr. Addison is
really a very great man with the juncto, and that he has got his elder
brother, who has been a factor abroad in those parts, to be Governor
of Fort St. George.... It seems Mr. Addison's friends can do what
they please with the chief of the East India Company, who, I think,
have the liberty of naming their Governor, and by management with
them this place is got, which they say some years is worth &pound;20,000"

Steele said, "Mr. Dean Addison, father of this memorable man, left
behind him four children, each of whom, for excellent talents and
singular perfections, was as much above the ordinary world as their
brother Joseph was above them. Were things of this nature to be
exposed to public view, I could show, under the Dean's own hand, in
the warmest terms, his blessing on the friendship between his son and
me; nor had he a child who did not prefer me in the first place of
kindness and esteem, as their father loved me like one of them."</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Oct. 11.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I find in the registers of my family, that the branch
of the Bickerstaffs from which I am descended, came
originally out of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> This has given me a kind
of natural affection for that country. It is therefore
with pleasure that I see not only some of the greatest
warriors, but also of the greatest wits, to be natives
of that kingdom. The gentleman who writes the
following letter is one of these last. The matter of
fact contained in it is literally true, though the diverting
manner in which it is told may give it the colour of
a fable.</p>


<h3>To <span class="smcap">Isaac Bickerstaff</span>, Esq., at his House
in Great Britain.</h3>

<p class="right"><em>Dublin</em>.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Finding by several passages of your <cite>Tatlers</cite>, that
you are a person curious in natural knowledge,
I thought it would not be unacceptable to you to give
you the following history of the migration of frogs into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>this country. There is an ancient tradition among the
wild philosophers of the kingdom, that this whole
island was once as much infested by frogs, as that
wherein Whittington made his fortune was by mice;
insomuch that it is said, Macdonald the First could no
more sleep by reason of these Dutch nightingales (as
they are called at Paris), than Pharaoh could when they
croaked in his bed-chamber. It was in the reign of
this great monarch that St. Patrick arrived in Ireland,
being as famous for destroying vermin as any rat-catcher
of our times. If we may believe the tradition,
he killed more in one day than a flock of storks could
have done in a twelvemonth. From that time for
about five hundred years, there was not a frog to be
heard in Ireland, notwithstanding the bogs still remained,
which in former ages had been so plentifully stocked
with those inhabitants.</p>

<p>"When the arts began to flourish in the reign of
King Charles the Second, and that great monarch had
placed himself at the head of the Royal Society, to lead
them forward into the discoveries of nature, it is said,
that several proposals were laid before his Majesty for
the importing of frogs into Ireland. In order to it,
a virtuoso of known abilities was unanimously elected
by the Society, and entrusted with the whole management
of that affair. For this end he took along with
him a sound, able-bodied frog, of a strong, hale constitution,
that had given proof of his vigour by several
leaps which he made before that learned body. They
took ship, and sailed together till they came within
sight of the Hill of Howth, before the frog discovered
any symptoms of being indisposed by his voyage: but
as the wind chopped about, and began to blow from
the Irish coast, he grew sea-sick, or rather land-sick;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
for his learned companion ascribed it to the particles
of the soil with which the wind was impregnated. He
was confirmed in his conjecture, when, upon the wind's
turning about, his fellow-traveller sensibly recovered,
and continued in good health till his arrival upon the
shore, where he suddenly relapsed, and expired upon
a Ring's End car<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> on his way to Dublin. The same
experiment was repeated several times in that reign,
but to no purpose. A frog was never known to take
three leaps upon Irish turf, before he stretched himself
out and died.</p>

<p>"Whether it were that the philosophers on this side
the water despaired of stocking the island with this
useful animal, or whether in the following reign it was
not thought proper to undo the miracle of a Popish
saint, I do not hear of any further progress made in
this affair till about two years after the battle of the

<p>"It was then that an ingenious physician,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> to the
honour as well as improvement of his native country,
performed what the English had been so long attempting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>in vain. This learned man, with the hazard of his life,
made a voyage to Liverpool, where he filled several
barrels with the choicest spawn of frogs that could be
found in those parts. This cargo he brought over very
carefully, and afterwards disposed of it in several warm
beds that he thought most capable of bringing it to
life. The doctor was a very ingenious physician, and
a very good Protestant; for which reason, to show his
zeal against Popery, he placed some of the most
promising spawn in the very fountain that is dedicated
to the Saint, and known by the name of St. Patrick's
Well, where these animals had the impudence to make
their first appearance. They have since that time very
much increased and multiplied in all the neighbourhood
of this city. We have here some curious inquirers
into natural history who observe their motions, with
a design to compute in how many years they will be
able to hop from Dublin to Wexford; though, as I am
informed, not one of them has yet passed the mountains
of Wicklow.</p>

<p>"I am further informed, that several graziers of the
county of Cork have entered into a project of planting
a colony in those parts, at the instance of the French
Protestants: and I know not but the same design may
be on foot in other parts of the kingdom, if the wisdom
of the British nation do not think fit to prohibit the
further importation of English frogs. I am,</p>

<p>There is no study more becoming a rational creature
than that of natural philosophy; but as several of our
modern virtuosos manage it, their speculations do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
so much tend to open and enlarge the mind, as to
contract and fix it upon trifles.</p>

<p>This in England is in a great measure owing to the
worthy elections that are so frequently made in our
Royal Society.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> They seem to be in a confederacy
against men of polite genius, noble thought, and
diffusive learning; and choose into their assemblies
such as have no pretence to wisdom, but want of wit;
or to natural knowledge, but ignorance of everything
else. I have made observations in this matter so long,
that when I meet with a young fellow that is a humble
admirer of the sciences, but more dull than the rest of
the company, I conclude him to be a Fellow of the
Royal Society.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Oct. 13.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Coming home last night before my usual hour, I took
a book into my hand, in order to divert myself with
it till bed-time. Milton chanced to be my author, whose
admirable poem of "Paradise Lost" serves, at once, to fill
the mind with pleasing ideas, and with good thoughts, and
was therefore the most proper book for my purpose. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>was amusing myself with that beautiful passage in which
the poet represents Eve sleeping by Adam's side, with
the devil sitting at her ear, and inspiring evil thoughts
under the shape of a toad. Ithuriel, one of the guardian
angels of the place, walking his nightly rounds, saw the
great enemy of mankind hid in this loathsome animal,
which he touched with his spear. This spear being of a
celestial temper, had such a secret virtue in it, that whatever
it was applied to, immediately flung off all disguise,
and appeared in its natural figure. I am afraid the reader
will not pardon me if I content myself with explaining
the passage in prose, without giving it in the author's
own inimitable words:</p>

<span class="i0"><em>Essaying by his devilish art to reach</em><br /></span>

<p>I could not forbear thinking how happy a man would
be in the possession of this spear; or what an advantage
it would be to a Minister of State, were he master of such
a white staff. It would let him discover his friends from
his enemies, men of abilities from pretenders: it would
hinder him from being imposed upon by appearances and
professions, and might be made use of as a kind of State
test, which no artifice could elude.</p>

<p>These thoughts made very lively impressions on my
imagination, which were improved, instead of being defaced
by sleep, and produced in me the following dream: I was
no sooner fallen asleep, but, methought, the angel Ithuriel
appeared to me, and with a smile that still added to his
celestial beauty, made me a present of the spear which he
held in his hand, and disappeared. To make trials of it,
I went into a place of public resort.</p>

<p>The first person that passed by me, was a lady that had
a particular shyness in the cast of her eye, and a more
than ordinary reservedness in all the parts of her behaviour.
She seemed to look upon man as an obscene
creature, with a certain scorn and fear of him. In the
height of her airs I touched her gently with my wand,
when, to my unspeakable surprise, she fell upon her back,
and kicked up her heels in such a manner as made me
blush in my sleep. As I was hasting away from this
undisguised prude, I saw a lady in earnest discourse with
another, and overheard her say with some vehemence,
"Never tell me of him, for I am resolved to die a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
virgin!" I had a curiosity to try her; but as soon as
I laid my wand upon her head, she immediately fell in
labour. My eyes were diverted from her by a man and
his wife, who walked near me hand-in-hand after a very
loving manner. I gave each of them a gentle tap, and
the next instant saw the woman in breeches, and the man
with a fan in his hand. It would be tedious to describe
the long series of metamorphoses that I entertained myself
with in my night's adventure, of Whigs disguised in
Tories, and Tories in Whigs; men in red coats that denounced
terror in their countenances, trembling at the
touch of my spear; others in black with peace in their
mouths, but swords in their hands. I could tell stories
of noblemen changed into usurers, and magistrates into
beadles; of free-thinkers into penitents, and reformers
into whoremasters. I must not, however, omit the mention
of a grave citizen that passed by me with a huge
clasped Bible under his arm, and a band of most immoderate
breadth; but upon a touch on the shoulder, he
let drop his book, and fell a-picking my pocket.</p>

<p>In the general I observed, that those who appeared
good, often disappointed my expectation; but that, on
the contrary, those who appeared very bad, still grew
worse upon the experiment; as the toad in Milton, which
one would have thought the most deformed part of the
creation, at Ithuriel's stroke, became more deformed, and
started up into a devil.</p>

<p>Among all the persons that I touched, there was but
one who stood the test of my wand; and after many
repetitions of the stroke, stuck to his form, and remained
steady and fixed in his first appearance. This was a
young man who boasted of foul distempers, wild debauches,
insults upon holy men, and affronts to religion.</p>

<p>My heart was extremely troubled at this vision: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
contemplation of the whole species, so entirely sunk in
corruption, filled my mind with a melancholy that is
inexpressible, and my discoveries still added to my
affliction.</p>

<p>In the midst of these sorrows which I had in my heart,
methought there passed by me a couple of coaches with
purple liveries. There sat in each of them a person with
a very venerable aspect. At the appearance of them, the
people who were gathered round me in great multitudes
divided into parties, as they were disposed to favour
either of those reverend persons. The enemies of one
of them begged me to touch him with my wand, and
assured me, I should see his lawn converted into a cloak.
The opposite party told me with as much assurance, that
if I laid my wand upon the other, I should see his garments
embroidered with fleurs-de-lis, and his head covered
with a cardinal's cap. I made the experiment, and, to
my great joy, saw them both, without any change, distributing
their blessings to the people, and praying for
those who had reviled them. Is it possible, thought I,
that good men, who are so few in number, should be
divided among themselves, and give better quarter to the
vicious that are in their party, than the most strictly
virtuous who are out of it? Are the ties of faction
above those of religion?&mdash;I was going on in my soliloquies,
but some sudden accident awakened me, when I
found my hand grasped, but my spear gone. The reflection
on so very odd a dream made me figure to myself,
what a strange face the world would bear, should all
mankind appear in their proper shapes and characters,
without hypocrisy and disguise? I am afraid the earth
we live upon would appear to other intellectual beings
no better than a planet peopled with monsters. This
should, methinks, inspire us with an honest ambition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
recommending ourselves to those invisible spies, and of
being what we would appear. There was one circumstance
in my foregoing dream which I at first intended
to conceal; but upon second thoughts, I cannot look
upon myself as a candid and impartial historian, if I do
not acquaint my reader, that upon taking Ithuriel's spear
into my hand, though I was before an old decrepid fellow,
I appeared a very handsome, jolly, black man. But I
know my enemies will say, this is praising my own beauty,
for which reason I will speak no more of it.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Oct. 16.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Storms at sea are so frequently described by the ancient
poets, and copied by the moderns, that whenever I
find the winds begin to rise in a new heroic poem, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
generally skip a leaf or two till I come into fair weather.
Virgil's Tempest is a masterpiece in this kind, and is
indeed so naturally drawn, that one who has made a
voyage can scarce read it without being sea-sick.</p>

<p>Land showers are no less frequent among the poets
than the former, but I remember none of them which
have not fallen in the country; for which reason they
are generally filled with the lowings of oxen and the
bleatings of sheep, and very often embellished with a
rainbow.</p>

<p>Virgil's Land Shower is likewise the best in its
kind: it is indeed a shower of consequence, and contributes
to the main design of the poem, by cutting off a
tedious ceremonial, and bringing matters to a speedy
conclusion between two potentates of different sexes.
My ingenious kinsman, Mr. Humphrey Wagstaff, who
treats of every subject after a manner that no other
author has done, and better than any other can do, has
sent me the description of a City Shower. I do not
question but the reader remembers my cousin's description
of the Morning as it breaks in town, which is printed
in the ninth <cite>Tatler</cite>, and is another exquisite piece of this
local poetry:</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Oct. 18.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is ridiculous for any man to criticise on the works
of another, who has not distinguished himself by his
own performances. A judge would make but an indifferent
figure who had never been known at the bar.
Cicero was reputed the greatest orator of his age and
country before he wrote a book "De Oratore"; and
Horace the greatest poet before he published his "Art
of Poetry." This observation arises naturally in any
one who casts his eye upon this last-mentioned author,
where he will find the criticisms placed in the latter end
of his book, that is, after the finest odes and satires in
the Latin tongue.</p>

<p>A modern, whose name I shall not mention,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> because I
would not make a silly paper sell, was born a critic and
an Examiner, and, like one of the race of the serpent's
teeth, came into the world with a sword in his hand.
His works put me in mind of the story that is told of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>German monk, who was taking a catalogue of a friend's
library, and meeting with a Hebrew book in it, entered
it under the title of "A book that has the beginning
where the end should be." This author, in the last of
his crudities, has amassed together a heap of quotations,
to prove that Horace and Virgil were both of them
modester men than myself, and if his works were to live
as long as mine, they might possibly give posterity a
notion, that Isaac Bickerstaff was a very conceited old
fellow, and as vain a man as either Tully or Sir Francis
Bacon. Had this serious writer fallen upon me only, I
could have overlooked it; but to see Cicero abused, is, I
must confess, what I cannot bear. The censure he passes
upon this great man runs thus: "The itch of being very
abusive, is almost inseparable from vainglory. Tully
has these two faults in so high a degree, that nothing
but his being the best writer in the world can make
amends for them." The scurrilous wretch goes on to
say I am as bad as Tully. His words are these: "And
yet the Tatler, in his paper of September 26, has outdone
him in both. He speaks of himself with more
arrogance, and with more insolence of others." I am
afraid by his discourse, this gentleman has no more read
Plutarch than he has Tully. If he had, he would have
observed a passage in that historian, wherein he has with
great delicacy distinguished between two passions which
are usually complicated in human nature, and which an
ordinary writer would not have thought of separating.
Not having my Greek spectacles by me, I shall quote the
passage word for word as I find it translated to my hand.
"Nevertheless, though he was intemperately fond of his
own praise, yet he was very free from envying others,
and most liberally profuse in commending both the
ancients and his contemporaries, as is to be understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
by his writings; and many of those sayings are still
recorded, as that concerning Aristotle, that he was a
river of flowing gold: of Plato's 'Dialogue,' that if
Jupiter were to speak, he would discourse as he did.
Theophrastus he was wont to call his peculiar delight;
and being asked, which of Demosthenes his orations he
liked best? he answered, the longest.</p>

<p>"And as for the eminent men of his own time, either
for eloquence or philosophy, there was not one of them
which he did not, by writing or speaking favourably of,
render more illustrious."</p>

<p>Thus the critic tells us, that Cicero was excessively
vainglorious and abusive; Plutarch, that he was vain,
but not abusive. Let the reader believe which of them
he pleases.</p>

<p>After this he complains to the world, that I call him
names; and that in my passion I said, he was "a flea, a
louse, an owl, a bat, a small wit, a scribbler, and a
nibbler." When he has thus bespoken his reader's pity,
he falls into that admirable vein of mirth, which I shall
set down at length, it being an exquisite piece of raillery,
and written in great gaiety of heart. "After this list of
names (viz., flea, louse, owl, bat, &amp;c.), I was surprised to
hear him say, that he has hitherto kept his temper pretty
well; I wonder how he will write when he has lost his
temper? I suppose, as he now is very angry and unmannerly,
he will then be exceeding courteous and
good-humoured." If I can outlive this raillery, I shall
be able to bear anything.</p>

<p>There is a method of criticism made use of by this
author (for I shall take care how I call him a scribbler
again), which may turn into ridicule any work that was
ever written, wherein there is a variety of thoughts: this
the reader will observe in the following words: "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
(meaning me) is so intent upon being something extraordinary,
that he scarce knows what he would be; and is
as fruitful in his similes, as a brother of his<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> whom I
lately took notice of. In the compass of a few lines he
compares himself to a fox, to Daniel Burgess, to the
Knight of the Red Cross, to an oak with ivy about it,
and to a great man with an equipage." I think myself
as much honoured by being joined in this part of his
paper with the gentleman whom he here calls my brother,
as I am in the beginning of it, by being mentioned with
Horace and Virgil.</p>

<p>It is very hard that a man cannot publish ten papers
without stealing from himself; but to show you that
this is only a knack of writing, and that the author is got
into a certain road of criticism, I shall set down his remarks
on the works of the gentleman whom he here glances
upon, as they stand in his sixth paper, and desire the reader
to compare them with the foregoing passage upon mine:</p>

<p>"In thirty lines his patron is a river, the <em>primum</em>
<em>mobile</em>, a pilot, a victim, the sun, anything, and nothing.
He bestows increase, conceals his source, makes the
machine move, teaches to steer, expiates our offences,
raises vapours, and looks larger as he sets."</p>

<p>What poem can be safe from this sort of criticism?
I think I was never in my life so much offended as at a
wag whom I once met with in a coffee-house: he had in
his hand one of the Miscellanies, and was reading the
following short copy of verses, which, without flattery
to the author,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> is, I think, as beautiful in its kind as any
one in the English tongue:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p><div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>When this coxcomb had done reading them, "Heyday!"
says he, "what instrument is this that Flavia
employs in such a manner as is not to be told, nor safely
seen? In ten lines it is a toy, a Cupid's bow, a fan, and
an engine in love. It has wanton motions, it wounds, it
cools, and inflames."</p>

<p>Such criticisms make a man of sense sick, and a fool
merry.</p>

<p>The next paragraph of the paper we are talking of
falls upon somebody whom I am at a loss to guess at:<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
but I find the whole invective turns upon a man who (it
seems) has been imprisoned for debt. Whoever he was,
I most heartily pity him; but at the same time must put
the Examiner in mind, that notwithstanding he is a critic,
he still ought to remember he is a Christian. Poverty
was never thought a proper subject for ridicule; and I
do not remember that I ever met with a satire upon a
beggar.</p>

<p>As for those little retortings of my own expressions,
of being dull by design, witty in October, shining, excelling,
and so forth; they are the common cavils of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
witling, who has no other method of showing his parts,
but by little variations and repetitions of the man's words
whom he attacks.</p>

<p>But the truth of it is, the paper before me, not only in
this particular, but in its very essence, is like Ovid's
echo:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>I should not have deserved the character of a censor,
had I not animadverted upon the above-mentioned
author by a gentle chastisement: but I know my reader
will not pardon me, unless I declare, that nothing of this
nature for the future (unless it be written with some
wit) shall divert me from my care of the public.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Oct. 20.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I do not remember that in any of my Lucubrations I
have touched upon that useful science of physic,
notwithstanding I have declared myself more than once
a professor of it. I have indeed joined the study of
astrology with it, because I never knew a physician
recommend himself to the public who had not a sister
art to embellish his knowledge in medicine. It has been
commonly observed in compliment to the ingenious of
our profession, that Apollo was god of verse as well as
physic; and in all ages the most celebrated practitioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of our country were the particular favourites of the
Muses. Poetry to physic is indeed like the gilding to a
pill; it makes the art shine, and covers the severity of
the doctor with the agreeableness of the companion.</p>

<p>The very foundation of poetry is good sense, if we
may allow Horace to be a judge of the art:</p>

<p class="center"><em>Scribendi recte sapere est et principium et fons.</em><a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
</p>

<p>And if so, we have reason to believe that the same man
who writes well can prescribe well, if he has applied
himself to the study of both. Besides, when we see a
man making profession of two different sciences, it is
natural for us to believe he is no pretender in that which
we are not judges of when we find him skilful in that
which we understand.</p>

<p>Ordinary quacks and charlatans are thoroughly sensible
how necessary it is to support themselves by these
collateral assistances, and therefore always lay their claim
to some supernumerary accomplishments which are
wholly foreign to their profession.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago it was impossible to walk the
streets without having an advertisement thrust into your
hand of a doctor who was arrived at the knowledge of the
green and red dragon, and had discovered the female
fern seed. Nobody ever knew what this meant; but
the green and red dragon so amused the people, that the
doctor lived very comfortably upon them. About the
same time there was pasted a very hard word upon every
corner of the streets. This, to the best of my remembrance,
was</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">TETRACHYMAGOGON</span>,
</p>

<p>which drew great shoals of spectators about it, who read
the bill that it introduced with unspeakable curiosity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
and when they were sick, would have nobody but this
learned man for their physician.</p>

<p>I once received an advertisement of one who had
studied thirty years by candle-light for the good of his
countrymen. He might have studied twice as long by
daylight, and never have been taken notice of: but lucubrations
cannot be overvalued. There are some who
have gained themselves great reputation for physic by
their birth, as the seventh son of a seventh son; and
others by not being born at all, as the Unborn Doctor,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
who, I hear, is lately gone the way of his patients, having
died worth five hundred pounds per annum, though he
was not born to a halfpenny.</p>

<p>My ingenious friend Dr. Saffold<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> succeeded my old
contemporary Dr. Lilly<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> in the studies both of physic
and astrology, to which he added that of poetry, as was
to be seen both upon the sign where he lived, and in the
bills which he distributed. He was succeeded by Dr.
Case,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> who erased the verses of his predecessor out of
the sign-post, and substituted in their stead two of his
own, which were as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Within this place</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Lives</em> Doctor <span class="smcap">Case</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He is said to have got more by this distich than Mr.
Dryden did by all his works. There would be no end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>of enumerating the several imaginary perfections and
unaccountable artifices by which this tribe of men ensnare
the minds of the vulgar, and gain crowds of admirers.
I have seen the whole front of a mountebank's stage
from one end to the other faced with patents, certificates,
medals, and great seals, by which the several princes of
Europe have testified their particular respect and esteem
for the doctor. Every great man with a sounding title
has been his patient. I believe I have seen twenty
mountebanks that have given physic to the Czar of
Muscovy. The great Duke of Tuscany escapes no
better. The Elector of Brandenburg was likewise a very
good patient.</p>

<p>This great condescension of the doctor draws upon
him much good-will from his audience; and it is ten to
one, but if any of them be troubled with an aching tooth,
his ambition will prompt him to get it drawn by a person
who has had so many princes, kings, and emperors under
his hands.</p>

<p>I must not leave this subject without observing, that
as physicians are apt to deal in poetry, apothecaries endeavour
to recommend themselves by oratory, and are
therefore without controversy the most eloquent persons
in the whole British nation. I would not willingly discourage
any of the arts, especially that of which I am a
humble professor; but I must confess, for the good of
my native country, I could wish there might be a suspension
of physic for some years, that our kingdom, which
has been so much exhausted by the wars, might have
leave to recruit itself.</p>

<p>As for myself, the only physic which has brought me
safe to almost the age of man, and which I prescribe to
all my friends, is abstinence. This is certainly the best
physic for prevention, and very often the most effectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
against a present distemper. In short, my recipe is,
Take nothing.</p>

<p>Were the body politic to be physicked like particular
persons, I should venture to prescribe to it after the same
manner. I remember when our whole island was shaken
with an earthquake some years ago, there was an impudent
mountebank who sold pills which (as he told the
country people) were very good against an earthquake.
It may perhaps be thought as absurd to prescribe a diet
for the allaying popular commotions, and national ferments.
But I am verily persuaded, that if in such a case
a whole people were to enter into a course of abstinence,
and eat nothing but water-gruel for a fortnight, it would
abate the rage and animosity of parties, and not a little
contribute to the cure of a distracted nation. Such a
fast would have a natural tendency to the procuring of
those ends for which a fast is usually proclaimed. If
any man has a mind to enter on such a voluntary abstinence,
it might not be improper to give him the caution
of Pythagoras in particular:<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p class="center"><em>Abstine a fabis.</em><br />
"Abstain from beans."
</p>

<p>That is, say the interpreters, meddle not with elections,
beans having been made use of by the voters among the
Athenians in the choice of magistrates.</p>

From <em>Saturday, Oct. 21</em>, to <em>Tuesday, Oct. 24, 1710</em>.</h2>


<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Oct. 23.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">A method of spending one's time agreeably is a thing
so little studied, that the common amusement of
our young gentlemen (especially of such as are at a distance
from those of the first breeding) is drinking. This
way of entertainment has custom of its side; but as much
as it has prevailed, I believe there have been very few
companies that have been guilty of excess this way, where
there have not happened more accidents which make
against than for the continuance of it. It is very common
that events arise from a debauch which are fatal, and
always such as are disagreeable. With all a man's reason
and good sense about him, his tongue is apt to utter
things out of mere gaiety of heart which may displease
his best friends. Who then would trust himself to the
power of wine, without saying more against it, than that
it raises the imagination, and depresses the judgment.
Were there only this single consideration, that we are less
masters of ourselves when we drink in the least proportion
above the exigencies of thirst; I say, were this all
that could be objected, it were sufficient to make us
abhor this vice. But we may go on to say, that as he
who drinks but a little is not master of himself, so he
who drinks much is a slave to himself. As for my part,
I ever esteemed a drunkard of all vicious persons the
most vicious: for if our actions are to be weighed and
considered according to the intention of them, what can
we think of him who puts himself into a circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
wherein he can have no intention at all, but incapacitates
himself for the duties and offices of life, by a suspension
of all his faculties. If a man considered, that he cannot
under the oppression of drink be a friend, a gentleman,
a master, or a subject; that he has so long banished himself
from all that is dear, and given up all that is sacred
to him, he would even then think of a debauch with
horror: but when he looks still further, and acknowledges,
that he is not only expelled out of all the relations
of life, but also liable to offend against them all,
what words can express the terror and detestation he
would have of such a condition? And yet he owns all
this of himself who says he was drunk last night.</p>

<p>As I have all along persisted in it, that all the vicious
in general are in a state of death, so I think I may add
to the non-existence of drunkards, that they died by their
own hands. He is certainly as guilty of suicide who
perishes by a slow, as he that is despatched by an immediate
poison. In my last Lucubration I proposed the
general use of water-gruel, and hinted that it might not
be amiss at this very season: but as there are some
whose cases, in regard to their families, will not admit
of delay, I have used my interest in several wards of the
city, that the wholesome restorative above mentioned
may be given in tavern kitchens to all the morning's
draught-men within the walls when they call for wine
before noon. For a further restraint and mark upon
such persons, I have given orders, that in all the offices
where policies are drawn upon lives, it shall be added to
the article which prohibits that the nominee should cross
the sea, the words, "Provided also, that the above-mentioned
A. B. shall not drink before dinner during the
term mentioned in this indenture."</p>

<p>I am not without hopes but by this method I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
bring some unsizable friends of mine into shape and
breath, as well as others who are languid and consumptive
into health and vigour. Most of the self-murderers
whom I yet hinted at, are such as preserve a certain regularity
in taking their poison, and make it mix pretty well
with their food: but the most conspicuous of those who
destroy themselves, are such as in their youth fall into
this sort of debauchery, and contract a certain uneasiness
of spirit, which is not to be diverted but by tippling as
often as they can fall into company in the day, and
conclude with downright drunkenness at night. These
gentlemen never know the satisfaction of youth, but skip
the years of manhood, and are decrepid soon after they
are of age. I was god-father to one of these old fellows.
He is now three-and-thirty, which is the grand climacteric
of a young drunkard. I went to visit the crazy
wretch this morning, with no other purpose but to rally
him under the pain and uneasiness of being sober.</p>

<p>But as our faults are double when they affect others
besides ourselves, so this vice is still more odious in a
married than a single man. He that is the husband of
a woman of honour, and comes home overloaded with
wine, is still more contemptible in proportion to the
regard we have to the unhappy consort of his bestiality.
The imagination cannot shape to itself anything more
monstrous and unnatural than the familiarities between
drunkenness and chastity. The wretched Astrea, who is
the perfection of beauty and innocence, has long been
thus condemned for life. The romantic tales of virgins
devoted to the jaws of monsters, have nothing in them
so terrible as the gift of Astrea to that bacchanal.</p>

<p>The reflection of such a match as spotless innocence
with abandoned lewdness, is what puts this vice in the
worst figure it can bear with regard to others; but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
it is looked upon with respect only to the drunkard himself,
it has deformities enough to make it disagreeable,
which may be summed up in a word, by allowing, that
he who resigns his reason, is actually guilty of all that
he is liable to from the want of reason.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Oct. 25.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It was with very great displeasure I heard this day a
man say of a companion of his with an air of approbation,
"You know Tom never fails of saying a spiteful
thing. He has a great deal of wit, but satire is his
particular talent. Did you mind how he put the young
fellow out of countenance that pretended to talk to
him?" Such impertinent applauses, which one meets
with every day, put me upon considering what true
raillery and satire were in themselves; and this, methought,
occurred to me from reflection upon the great
and excellent persons that were admired for talents this
way. When I had run over several such in my thoughts,
I concluded (however unaccountable the assertion might
appear at first sight) that good-nature was an essential
quality in a satirist, and that all the sentiments which
are beautiful in this way of writing must proceed from
that quality in the author. Good-nature produces a
disdain of all baseness, vice, and folly, which prompts
them to express themselves with smartness against the
errors of men, without bitterness towards their persons.
This quality keeps the mind in equanimity, and never
lets an offence unseasonably throw a man out of his
character. When Virgil said, he that did not hate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Bavius might love M&aelig;vius,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> he was in perfect good-humour,
and was not so much moved at their absurdities
as passionately to call them sots or blockheads in a
direct invective, but laughed at them with a delicacy of
scorn, without any mixture of anger.</p>

<p>The best good man, with the worst-natured muse, was
the character among us of a gentleman as famous for
his humanity as his wit.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The ordinary subjects for satire are such as incite the
greatest indignation in the best tempers, and consequently
men of such a make are the best qualified for speaking
of the offences in human life. These men can behold
vice and folly when they injure persons to whom they
are wholly unacquainted, with the same severity as others
resent the ills they do themselves. A good-natured man
cannot see an overbearing fellow put a bashful man of
merit out of countenance, or outstrip him in the pursuit
of any advantage; but he is on fire to succour the
oppressed, to produce the merit of the one, and confront
the impudence of the other.</p>

<p>The men of the greatest character in this kind were
Horace and Juvenal. There is not, that I remember,
one ill-natured expression in all their writings, not one
sentence of severity which does not apparently proceed
from the contrary disposition. Whoever reads them,
will, I believe, be of this mind; and if they were read
with this view, it may possibly persuade our young
fellows, that they may be very witty men without
speaking ill of any but those who deserve it: but in the
perusal of these writers it may not be unnecessary to
consider, that they lived in very different times. Horace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>was intimate with a prince of the greatest goodness and
humanity imaginable, and his court was formed after his
example; therefore the faults that poet falls upon were
little inconsistencies in behaviour, false pretences to
politeness, or impertinent affectations of what men were
not fit for. Vices of a coarser sort could not come
under his consideration, or enter the palace of Augustus.
Juvenal, on the other hand, lived under Domitian, in
whose reign everything that was great and noble was
banished the habitations of the men in power. Therefore
he attacks vice as it passes by in triumph, not as
it breaks into conversation. The fall of empire, contempt
of glory, and a general degeneracy of manners,
are before his eyes in all his writings. In the days of
Augustus, to have talked like Juvenal had been madness,
or in those of Domitian like Horace. Morality and
virtue are everywhere recommended in Horace, as became
a man in a polite court, from the beauty, the propriety,
the convenience, of pursuing them. Vice and corruption
are attacked by Juvenal in a style which denotes, he
fears he shall not be heard without he calls to them in
their own language, with a bare-faced mention of the
villanies and obscenities of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>This accidental talk of these two great men runs me
from my design, which was to tell some coxcombs that
run about this town with the name of smart satirical
fellows, that they are by no means qualified for the
characters they pretend to, of being severe upon other
men, for they want good-nature. There is no foundation
in them for arriving at what they aim at; and they
may as well pretend to flatter, as rail agreeably without
being good-natured.</p>

<p>There is a certain impartiality necessary to make what
a man says bear any weight with those he speaks to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
This quality, with respect to men's errors and vices, is
never seen but in good-natured men. They have ever
such a frankness of mind, and benevolence to all men,
that they cannot receive impressions of unkindness without
mature deliberation; and writing or speaking ill of
a man upon personal considerations, is so irreparable and
mean an injury, that no one possessed of this quality is
capable of doing it: but in all ages there have been
interpreters to authors when living, of the same genius
with the commentators, into whose hands they fall when
dead. I dare say, it is impossible for any man of more
wit than one of these to take any of the four-and-twenty
letters, and form out of them a name to describe the
character of a vicious man with greater life, but one of
these would immediately cry, Mr. Such-a-one is meant in
that place. But the truth of it is, satirists describe the
age, and backbiters assign their descriptions to private
men.</p>

<p>In all terms of reproof, when the sentence appears to
arise from personal hatred or passion, it is not then made
the cause of mankind, but a misunderstanding between
two persons. For this reason, the representations of a
good-natured man bear a pleasantry in them, which
shows there is no malignity at heart, and by consequence
are attended to by his hearers or readers because they
are unprejudiced. This deference is only what is due to
him; for no man thoroughly nettled can say a thing
general enough to pass off with the air of an opinion
declared, and not a passion gratified. I remember a
humorous fellow at Oxford, when he heard any one had
spoken ill of him, used to say, "I won't take my revenge
of him till I have forgiven him." What he meant by
this, was, that he would not enter upon this subject till
it was grown as indifferent to him as any other; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
have, by this rule, seen him more than once triumph
over his adversary with an inimitable spirit and humour;
for he came to the assault against a man full of sore
places, and he himself invulnerable.</p>

<p>There is no possibility of succeeding in a satirical way
of writing or speaking, except a man throws himself
quite out of the question. It is great vanity to think
any one will attend a thing because it is your quarrel.
You must make your satire the concern of society in
general, if you would have it regarded. When it is so,
the good-nature of a man of wit will prompt him to
many brisk and disdainful sentiments and replies, to
which all the malice in the world will not be able to
repartee.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Oct. 27.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have somewhere made mention of Gyges's ring,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and
intimated to my reader, that it was at present in my
possession, though I have not since made any use of it.
The tradition concerning this ring is very romantic, and
taken notice of both by Plato and Tully, who each of
them make an admirable use of it for the advancement
of morality. This Gyges was the master shepherd to
King Candaules. As he was wandering over the plains
of Lydia, he saw a great chasm in the earth, and had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>curiosity to enter it. After having descended pretty far
into it, he found the statue of a horse in brass, with
doors in the sides of it. Upon opening of them, he
found the body of a dead man bigger than ordinary,
with a ring upon his finger, which he took off, and put
it upon his own. The virtues of it were much greater
than he at first imagined; for upon his going into the
assembly of shepherds, he observed, that he was invisible
when he turned the stone of the ring within the palm of
his hand, and visible when he turned it towards his
company. Had Plato and Cicero been as well versed in
the occult sciences as I am, they would have found a
great deal of mystic learning in this tradition; but it
is impossible for an adept to be understood by one who
is not an adept.</p>

<p>As for myself, I have with much study and application
arrived at this great secret of making myself invisible,
and by that means conveying myself where I pleased; or
to speak in Rosicrucian lore, I have entered into the
clefts of the earth, discovered the brazen horse, and
robbed the dead giant of his ring. The tradition says
further of Gyges, that by the means of this ring he
gained admission into the most retired parts of the
court, and made such use of those opportunities, that
he at length became King of Lydia. For my own part,
I, who have always rather endeavoured to improve my
mind than my fortune, have turned this ring to no other
advantage than to get a thorough insight into the ways
of men, and to make such observations upon the errors
of others as may be useful to the public, whatever effect
they may have upon myself.</p>

<p>About a week ago, not being able to sleep, I got up
and put on my magical ring, and with a thought transported
myself into a chamber where I saw a light. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
found it inhabited by a celebrated beauty, though she is
of that species of women which we call a slattern. Her
head-dress and one of her shoes lay upon a chair, her
petticoat in one corner of the room, and her girdle, that
had a copy of verses made upon it but the day before,
with her thread stockings, in the middle of the floor. I
was so foolishly officious, that I could not forbear gathering
up her clothes together to lay them upon the chair
that stood by her bedside, when, to my great surprise,
after a little muttering, she cried out, "What do you do?
Let my petticoat alone." I was startled at first, but
soon found that she was in a dream; being one of those
who, to use Shakespeare's expression, are "so loose of
thought,"<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> that they utter in their sleep everything that
passes in their imagination. I left the apartment of this
female rake, and went into her neighbour's, where there
lay a male coquet. He had a bottle of salts hanging
over his head, and upon the table, by his bedside,
Suckling's Poems, with a little heap of black patches
on it. His snuff-box was within reach on a chair: but
while I was admiring the disposition which he made of
the several parts of his dress, his slumber seemed interrupted
by a pang, that was accompanied by a sudden
oath, as he turned himself over hastily in his bed. I
did not care for seeing him in his nocturnal pains, and
left the room.</p>

<p>I was no sooner got into another bed-chamber, but I
heard very harsh words uttered in a smooth uniform
tone. I was amazed to hear so great a volubility in
reproach, and thought it too coherent to be spoken by
one asleep; but upon looking nearer, I saw the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>dress
of the person who spoke, which showed her to be
a female with a man lying by her side broad awake, and
as quiet as a lamb. I could not but admire his exemplary
patience, and discovered by his whole behaviour,
that he was then lying under the discipline of a curtain
lecture.</p>

<p>I was entertained in many other places with this kind
of nocturnal eloquence, but observed, that most of those
whom I found awake, were kept so either by envy or by
love. Some of these were fighting, and others cursing,
in soliloquy; some hugged their pillows, and others
gnashed their teeth.</p>

<p>The covetous I likewise found to be a very wakeful
people. I happened to come into a room where one of
them lay sick. His physician and his wife were in close
whisper near his bedside. I overheard the doctor say to
the poor gentlewoman, "He cannot possibly live till five
in the morning." She received it like the mistress of a
family prepared for all events. At the same instant
came in a servant-maid, who said, "Madam, the undertaker
is below according to your order." The words
were scarce out of her mouth, when the sick man cried
out with a feeble voice, "Pray, doctor, how went bank-stock
to-day at 'Change?" This melancholy object
made me too serious for diverting myself further this
way: but as I was going home, I saw a light in a garret,
and entering into it, heard a voice crying, "And, hand,
stand, band, fanned, tanned." I concluded him by this,
and the furniture of his room, to be a lunatic; but
upon listening a little longer, perceived it was a poet,
writing an heroic upon the ensuing peace.</p>

<p>It was now towards morning, an hour when spirits,
witches, and conjurers are obliged to retire to their
own apartments, and feeling the influence of it, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
hastening home, when I saw a man had got half way
into a neighbour's house. I immediately called to him,
and turning my ring, appeared in my proper person.
There is something magisterial in the aspect of the
Bickerstaffs, which made him run away in confusion.</p>

<p>As I took a turn or two in my own lodging, I was
thinking, that, old as I was, I need not go to bed alone,
but that it was in my power to marry the finest lady in
this kingdom, if I would wed her with this ring. For
what a figure would she that should have it make at a
visit, with so perfect a knowledge as this would give her
of all the scandal in the town? But instead of endeavouring
to dispose of myself and it in matrimony,
I resolved to lend it to my loving friend the author of
the "Atalantis,"<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> to furnish a new Secret History of

we meet crowds who attempt to be eloquent before
they can speak. They affect the flowers of rhetoric
before they understand the parts of speech. In the
ordinary conversation of this town, there are so many
who can, as they call it, talk well, that there is not
one in twenty that talks to be understood. This proceeds
from an ambition to excel, or, as the term is,
to shine, in company. The matter is not to make
themselves understood, but admired. They come together
with a certain emulation, rather than benevolence.
When you fall among such companions, the safe way
is to give yourself up, and let the orators declaim
for your esteem, and trouble yourself no further. It is
said that a poet must be born so; but I think it may be
much better said of an orator, especially when we talk
of our town poets and orators; but the town poets are
full of rules and laws, the town orators go through
thick and thin, and are, forsooth, persons of such eminent
natural parts and knowledge of the world, that
they despise all men as inexperienced scholastics who
wait for an occasion before they speak, or who speak
no more than is necessary. They had half persuaded
me to go to the tavern the other night, but that a
gentleman whispered me, "Prithee, Isaac, go with us;
there is Tom Varnish will be there, and he is a fellow
that talks as well as any man in England."</p>

<p>I must confess, when a man expresses himself well
upon any occasion, and his falling into an account of
any subject arises from a desire to oblige the company,
or from fulness of the circumstance itself, so that his
speaking of it at large is occasioned only by the openness
of a companion; I say, in such a case as this, it
is not only pardonable, but agreeable, when a man takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the discourse to himself; but when you see a fellow
watch for opportunities for being copious, it is excessively
troublesome. A man that stammers, if he has
understanding, is to be attended with patience and good-nature;
but he that speaks more than he need, has no
right to such an indulgence. The man who has a
defect in his speech takes pains to come to you, while
a man of a weak capacity with fluency of speech triumphs
in outrunning you. The stammerer strives to be fit for
your company; the loquacious man endeavours to show
you, you are not fit for his.</p>

<p>With thoughts of this kind do I always enter into
that man's company who is recommended as a person
that talks well; but if I were to choose the people with
whom I would spend my hours of conversation, they
should be certainly such as laboured no further than to
make themselves readily and clearly apprehended, and
would have patience and curiosity to understand me.
To have good sense, and ability to express it, are the
most essential and necessary qualities in companions.
When thoughts rise in us fit to utter, among familiar
friends there needs but very little care in clothing them.</p>

<p>Urbanus is, I take it, a man one might live with
whole years, and enjoy all the freedom and improvement
imaginable, and yet be insensible of a contradiction to
you in all the mistakes you can be guilty of. His great
good-will to his friends has produced in him such a
general deference in his discourse, that if he differs from
you in his sense of anything, he introduces his own
thoughts by some agreeable circumlocution, or he has
often observed such and such a circumstance that made
him of another opinion. Again, where another would
be apt to say, "This I am confident of; I may pretend to
judge of this matter as well as anybody;" Urbanus says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
"I am verily persuaded; I believe one may conclude."
In a word, there is no man more clear in his thoughts
and expressions than he is, or speaks with greater diffidence.
You shall hardly find one man of any consideration,
but you shall observe one of less consequence form
himself after him. This happens to Urbanus; but the
man who steals from him almost every sentiment he
utters in a whole week, disguises the theft, by carrying it
with quite a different air. Umbratilis knows Urbanus's
doubtful way of speaking proceeds from good-nature and
good-breeding, and not from uncertainty in his opinions.
Umbratilis therefore has no more to do but repeat the
thoughts of Urbanus in a positive manner, and appear
to the undiscerning a wiser man than the person from
whom he borrows: but those who know him, can see the
servant in his master's habit; and the more he struts, the
less do his clothes appear his own.</p>

<p>In conversation, the medium is neither to affect silence
or eloquence; not to value our approbation, and to
endeavour to excel us who are of your company, are
equal injuries. The great enemies therefore to good
company, and those who transgress most against the laws
of equality (which is the life of it), are, the clown, the
wit, and the pedant. A clown, when he has sense, is
conscious of his want of education, and with an awkward
bluntness hopes to keep himself in countenance, by overthrowing
the use of all polite behaviour. He takes
advantage of the restraint good-breeding lays upon others
not to offend him to trespass against them, and is under
the man's own shelter while he intrudes upon him. The
fellows of this class are very frequent in the repetition of
the words "rough" and "manly." When these people
happen to be by their fortunes of the rank of gentlemen,
they defend their other absurdities by an impertinent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
courage; and to help out the defect of their behaviour, add
their being dangerous to their being disagreeable. This
gentleman (though he displeases, professes to do so, and
knowing that, dares still go on to do so) is not so painful
a companion as he who will please you against your will,
and resolves to be a wit.</p>

<p>This man upon all occasions, and whoever he falls in
company with, talks in the same circle, and in the same
round of chat which he has learned at one of the tables
of this coffee-house. As poetry is in itself an elevation
above ordinary and common sentiments, so there is no
fop is so very near a madman in indifferent company as a
poetical one. He is not apprehensive that the generality
of the world are intent upon the business of their own
fortune and profession, and have as little capacity as
curiosity to enter into matters of ornament or speculation.
I remember at a full table in the city, one of
these ubiquitary wits was entertaining the company with
a soliloquy (for so I call it when a man talks to those
who do not understand him) concerning wit and humour.
An honest gentleman who sat next to me, and was worth
half a plum, stared at him, and observing there was
some sense, as he thought, mixed with his impertinence,
whispered me, "Take my word for it, this fellow is
more knave than fool." This was all my good friend's
applause of the wittiest man of talk that I was ever
present at, which wanted nothing to make it excellent
but that there was no occasion for it.</p>

<p>The pedant is so obvious to ridicule, that it would be
to be one to offer to explain him. He is a gentleman so
well known, that there is none but those of his own class
who do not laugh at and avoid him. Pedantry proceeds
from much reading and little understanding. A pedant
among men of learning and sense, is like an ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
servant giving an account of a polite conversation. You
may find he has brought with him more than could have
entered into his head without being there, but still that
he is not a bit wiser than if he had not been there
at all.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Nov. 3.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">When one considers the turn which conversation takes
in almost every set of acquaintance, club or assembly,
in this town or kingdom, one cannot but observe,
that in spite of what I am every day saying, and all the
moral writers since the beginning of the world have said,
the subject of discourse is generally upon one another's
faults. This in a great measure proceeds from self-conceit,
which were to be endured in one or other individual
person; but the folly has spread itself almost over
all the species; and one cannot only say, Tom, Jack, or
Will, but in general, that man is a coxcomb. From this
source it is that any excellence is faintly received, any
imperfection unmercifully exposed. But if things were
put in a true light, and we would take time to consider
that man in his very nature is an imperfect being, our
sense of this matter would be immediately altered, and the
word "imperfection" would not carry an unkinder idea
than the word "humanity." It is a pleasant story, that we,
forsooth, who are the only imperfect creatures in the
universe, are the only beings that will not allow of imperfection.
Somebody has taken notice, that we stand in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>the middle of existences, and are by this one circumstance
the most unhappy of all others. The brutes are guided
by instinct, and know no sorrow; the angels have knowledge,
and they are happy; but men are governed by
opinion, which is I know not what mixture of instinct
and knowledge, and are neither indolent nor happy. It
is very observable, that critics are a people between the
learned and the ignorant, and by that situation enjoy the
tranquillity of neither. As critics stand among men, so
do men in general between brutes and angels. Thus
every man as he is a critic and a coxcomb, till improved
by reason and speculation, is ever forgetting himself, and
laying open the faults of others.</p>

<p>At the same time that I am talking of the cruelty of
urging people's faults with severity, I cannot but bewail
some which men are guilty of for want of admonition.
These are such as they can easily mend, and nobody tells
them of; for which reason I shall make use of the penny-post
(as I have with success to several young ladies about
turning their eyes, and holding up their heads) to certain
gentlemen whom I remark habitually guilty of what they
may reform in a moment. There is a fat fellow whom
I have long remarked wearing his breast open in the
midst of winter, out of an affectation of youth. I have
therefore sent him just now the following letter in my
physical capacity:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"From the twentieth instant to the first of May next,
both days inclusive, I beg of you to button your

<p>There is a very handsome well-shaped youth that frequents

This being something new, and a thing in which the
gentleman may offend the Heralds' Office, I have addressed
myself to him as I am censor:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Countryman</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Was that ensign of honour which you wear, given
you by a prince or a lady that you have served?
If you bear it as an absent lover, please to hang it on a
black ribbon; if as a rewarded soldier, you may have my
licence to continue the red.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"Your faithful Servant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 16.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>, <em>Censor</em>."</span><br />
</p>

<p>These little intimations do great service, and are very
useful, not only to the persons themselves, but to inform
others how to conduct themselves towards them.</p>

<p>Instead of this honest private method, or a friendly
one face to face, of acquainting people with things in
their power to explain or amend, the usual way among
people is to take no notice of things you can help, and
nevertheless expose you for those you cannot.</p>

<p>Plumbeus and Levis are constantly in each other's
company: they would, if they took proper methods, be
very agreeable companions; but they so extravagantly
aim at what they are unfit for, and each of them rallies
the other so much in the wrong place, that instead of
doing each other the offices of friends, they do but instruct
the rest of the world to laugh at them with more
knowledge and skill. Plumbeus is of a saturnine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
sullen complexion; Levis, of a mercurial and airy disposition.
Both these gentlemen have but very slow
parts, but would make a very good figure, did they
pursue what they ought. If Plumbeus would take to
business, he would in a few years know the forms of
orders so well, as to direct and dictate with so much
ease, as to be thought a solid, able, and at the same time
a sure man of despatch. Levis, with a little reading and
coming more into company, would soon be able to write
a song, or lead up a country-dance. Instead of these
proper pursuits, in obedience to their respective geniuses,
Plumbeus endeavours to be the man of pleasure, and
Levis the man of business. This appears in their speech,
and in their dress: Plumbeus is ever egregiously fine,
and talking something like wit; Levis is ever extremely
grave, and with a silly face repeating maxims. These
two pardon each other for affecting what each is incapable
of, the one to be wise, and the other gay; but are
extremely critical in their judgments of each other in
their way towards what they pretend to. Plumbeus
acknowledges Levis a man of a great reach, because it is
what Plumbeus never cared for being thought himself;
and Levis allows Plumbeus to be an agreeable rake for
the same reason. Now were these dear friends to be
free with each other as they ought to be, they would
change characters, and be both as commendable, instead
of being as ridiculous, as their capacities will admit of.</p>

<p>Were it not too grave, all that I would urge on this
subject is, that men are bewildered when they consider
themselves in any other view than that of strangers, who
are in a place where it is no great matter whether they
can, or unreasonable to expect they should, have everything
about them as well as at their own home. This
way of thinking is, perhaps, the only one that can put
this being into a proper posture for the ease of society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
It is certain, this would reduce all faults into those
which proceed from malice or dishonesty: it would
quite change our manner of beholding one another, and
nothing that was not below a man's nature would be
below his character. The arts of this life would be
proper advances towards the next; and a very good man
would be a very fine gentleman. As it now is, human
life is inverted, and we have not learned half the knowledge
of this world before we are dropping into another.
Thus, instead of the raptures and contemplations which
naturally attend a well-spent life from the approach of
eternity, even we old fellows are afraid of the ridicule
of those who are born since us, and ashamed not to
understand, as well as peevish to resign, the mode, the
fashion, the ladies, the fiddles, the balls, and what not.
Dick Reptile, who does not want humour, is very pleasant
at our club when he sees an old fellow touchy at
being laughed at for anything that is not in the mode,
and bawls in his ear, "Prithee don't mind him; tell him
thou art mortal."</p>

<p class="drop-cap">My brother, having written the above piece of Latin,
desired me to take care of the rest of the ensuing
paper. Towards this he bid me answer the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
letter, and said, nothing I could write properly on the
subject of it would be disagreeable to the motto. It is
the cause of my sex, and I therefore enter upon it with
great alacrity. The epistle is literally thus:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right"><em>Edinburgh, Oct. 23</em>.</p>

<p>
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I presume to lay before you an affair of mine, and
begs you'le be very sinceir in giving me your
judgment and advice in this matter, which is as followes:</p>

<p>"A very agreeable young gentleman, who is endowed
with all the good quallities that can make a man compleat,
has this long time maid love to me in the most
passionat manner that was posable. He has left nothing
unsaid to make me belive his affections real; and in his
letters expressed himself so hansomly, and so tenderly,
that I had all the reason imaginable to belive him sinceir.
In short, he positively has promised me he would marry
me: but I find all he said nothing; for when the
question was put to him, he wouldn't; but still would
continue my humble servant, and would go on at the
ould rate, repeating the assurences of his fidelity (and
at the same time has none in him). He now writs to
me in the same endearing style he ust to do, would have
me spake to no man but himself. His estate is in his
oune hand, his father being dead. My fortune at my
oune disposal (mine being also dead), and to the full
answers his estate. Pray, sir, be ingeinous, and tell me
cordially, if you don't think I shall do myself an injurey
if I keep company or a corospondance any longer with
this gentleman. I hope you'le faver an honest North
Briton (as I am) with your advice in this amoure; for
I am resolved just to folow your directions. Sir, you'le
do me a sensable pleasure, and very great honour, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
you'le pleas to insirt this poor scrole, with your answer
to it, in your <cite>Tatler</cite>. Pray fail not to give me your
answer; for on it depends the happiness of</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Disconsolat Almeira</span>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I have frequently read over your letter, and am of
opinion, that as lamentable as it is, it is the most
common of any evil that attends our sex. I am very
much troubled for the tenderness you express towards
your lover, but rejoice at the same time that you can
so far surmount your inclination for him as to resolve
to dismiss him when you have my brother's opinion for
it. His sense of the matter he desired me to communicate
to you. O Almeira! the common failing of our
sex is to value the merit of our lovers rather from the
grace of their address than the sincerity of their hearts.
'He has expressed himself so handsomely!' Can you say
that after you have reason to doubt his truth? It is a
very melancholy thing, that in this circumstance of love
(which is the most important of all others in female
life) we women, who are, they say, always weak, are
still weakest. The true way of valuing a man, is to
consider his reputation among the men: for want of
this necessary rule towards our conduct, when it is too
late we find ourselves married to the outcasts of that
sex; and it is generally from being disagreeable among
men, that fellows endeavour to make themselves pleasing
to us. The little accomplishments of coming into a
room with a good air, and telling while they are with
us what we cannot hear among ourselves, usually make
up the whole of a woman's man's merit. But if we,
when we began to reflect upon our lovers, in the first
place considered what figures they make in the camp, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the bar, on the 'Change, in their country, or at court,
we should behold them in quite another view than at
present.</p>

<p>"Were we to behave ourselves according to this rule,
we should not have the just imputation of favouring the
silliest of mortals, to the great scandal of the wisest,
who value our favour as it advances their pleasure, not
their reputation. In a word, madam, if you would
judge aright in love, you must look upon it as in a case
of friendship. Were this gentleman treating with you
for anything but yourself, when you had consented to
his offer, if he fell off, you would call him a cheat and
an impostor. There is therefore nothing left for you
to do, but to despise him and yourself for doing with
regret.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">"I am,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 29.5em;">"Madam, &amp;c."</span><br />
</p>

<p>I have heard it often argued in conversation, that this
evil practice is owing to the perverted taste of the wits
in the last generation. A libertine on the throne could
very easily make the language and the fashion turn his
own way. Hence it is, that woman is treated as a
mistress, and not a wife. It is from the writings of
those times, and the traditional accounts of the debauches
of their men of pleasure, that the coxcombs nowadays
take upon them, forsooth, to be false swains and perjured
lovers. Methinks I feel all the woman rise in me,
when I reflect upon the nauseous rogues that pretend to
deceive us. Wretches, that can never have it in their
power to overreach anything living but their mistresses!
In the name of goodness, if we are designed by nature
as suitable companions to the other sex, why are we not
treated accordingly? If we have merit, as some allow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
why is it not as base in men to injure us as one another?
If we are the insignificants that others call us, where is
the triumph in deceiving us? But when I look at the
bottom of this disaster, and recollect the many of my
acquaintance whom I have known in the same condition
with the Northern lass that occasions this discourse, I
must own I have ever found the perfidiousness of men
has been generally owing to ourselves, and we have
contributed to our own deceit. The truth is, we do
not conduct ourselves as we are courted, but as we are
inclined. When we let our imaginations take this
unbridled swing, it is not he that acts best is most
lovely, but he that is most lovely acts best. When our
humble servants make their addresses, we do not keep
ourselves enough disengaged to be judges of their merit;
and we seldom give our judgment of our lover, till we
have lost our judgment for him.</p>

<p>While Clarinda was passionately attended and addressed
to by Strephon, who is a man of sense and knowledge in
the world, and Cassio, who has a plentiful fortune and
an excellent understanding, she fell in love with Damon
at a ball: from that moment she that was before the
most reasonable creature of all my acquaintance, cannot
hear Strephon speak, but it is something "so out of the
way of ladies' conversation;" and Cassio has never since
opened his mouth before us, but she whispers me, "How
seldom do riches and sense go together!" The issue of
all this is, that for the love of Damon, who has neither
experience, understanding, or wealth, she despises those
advantages in the other two which she finds wanting in
her lover; or else thinks he has them for no reason but
because he is her lover. This and many other instances
may be given in this town; but I hope thus much may
suffice to prevent the growth of such evils at Edinburgh.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Nov. 8.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It may perhaps appear ridiculous; but I must confess,
this last summer as I was riding in Enfield Chase, I
met a young lady whom I could hardly get out of my
head, and for aught I know my heart, ever since.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> She
was mounted on a pad, with a very well-fancied furniture.
She sat her horse with a very graceful air; and
when I saluted her with my hat, she bowed to me so
obligingly, that whether it was her civility or beauty that
touched me so much, I know not, but I am sure I shall
never forget her. She dwells in my imagination in a
figure so much to her advantage, that if I were to draw
a picture of youth, health, beauty, or modesty, I should
represent any or all of them in the person of that young
woman.</p>

<p>I do not find that there are any descriptions in the
ancient poets so beautiful as those they draw of nymphs
in their pastoral dresses and exercises. Virgil gives Venus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
the habit of a Spartan huntress when she is to put &AElig;neas
in his way, and relieve his cares with the most agreeable
object imaginable.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Diana and her train are always
described as inhabitants of the woods, and followers of
the chase. To be well diverted, is the safest guard to
innocence; and, methinks, it should be one of the first
things to be regarded among people of condition to find
out proper amusements for young ladies. I cannot but
think this of riding might easily be revived among them,
when they consider how much it must contribute to their
beauty. This would lay up the best portion they could
bring into a family, a good stock of health to transmit
to their posterity. Such a charming bloom as this gives
the countenance, is very much preferable to the real or
affected feebleness or softness which appear in the faces
of our modern beauties.</p>

<p>The comedy called "The Ladies' Cure,"<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> represents
the affectation of wan looks and languid glances to a
very entertaining extravagance. There is, as the lady
in the play complains, something so robust in perfect
health, that it is with her a point of breeding and
delicacy to appear in public with a sickly air. But the
natural gaiety and spirit which shine in the complexion
of such as form to themselves a sort of diverting industry
by choosing recreations that are exercises, surpass all the
false ornaments and graces that can be put on by applying
the whole dispensary of a toilet. A healthy body
and a cheerful mind give charms as irresistible as inimitable.
The beauteous Dyctinna, who came to town last
week, has, from the constant prospect in a delicious
country, and the moderate exercise and journeys in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>visits she made round it, contracted a certain life in her
countenance which will in vain employ both the painters
and poets to represent. The becoming negligence in her
dress, the severe sweetness of her looks, and a certain
innocent boldness in all her behaviour, are the effect of
the active recreations I am talking of.</p>

<p>But instead of such or any other as innocent and
pleasing method of passing away their time with alacrity,
we have many in town who spend their hours in an
indolent state of body and mind, without either recreations
or reflections. I am apt to believe, there are some
parents imagine their daughters will be accomplished
enough, if nothing interrupts their growth or their shape.
According to this method of education, I could name
you twenty families, where all the girls hear of in this
life is, that it is time to rise and to come to dinner; as
if they were so insignificant as to be wholly provided for
when they are fed and clothed.</p>

<p>It is with great indignation that I see such crowds of
the female world lost to human society, and condemned
to a laziness which makes life pass away with less relish
than in the hardest labour. Palestris, in her drawing-room,
is supported by spirits to keep off the returns of
spleen and melancholy, before she can get over half the
day for want of something to do, while the wench in the
kitchen sings and scours from morning to night.</p>

<p>The next disagreeable thing to a lazy lady is a very
busy one. A man of business in good company, who
gives an account of his abilities and despatches, is hardly
more insupportable than her they call a notable woman
and a manager. Lady Goodday, where I visited the other
day at a very polite circle, entertained a great lady with
a recipe for a poultice, and gave us to understand, that
she had done extraordinary cures since she was last in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
town. It seems a countryman had wounded himself
with his scythe as he was mowing; and we were obliged
to hear of her charity, her medicine, and her humility,
in the harshest tone and coarsest language imaginable.</p>

<p>What I would request in all this prattle is, that our
females would either let us have their persons or their
minds in such perfection as nature designed them.</p>

<p>The way to this is, that those who are in the quality
of gentlewomen should propose to themselves some suitable
method of passing away their time. This would
furnish them with reflections and sentiments proper for
the companions of reasonable men, and prevent the
unnatural marriages which happen every day between
the most accomplished women and the veriest oafs,
the worthiest men and the most insignificant females.
Were the general turn of women's education of another
kind than it is at present, we should want one another
for more reasons than we do as the world now goes.
The common design of parents is to get their girls off
as well as they can, and make no conscience of putting
into our hands a bargain for our whole life which will
make our hearts ache every day of it.</p>

<p>I shall therefore take this matter into serious consideration,
and will propose, for the better improvement
of the fair sex, a female library.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> This collection of
books shall consist of such authors as do not corrupt
while they divert, but shall tend more immediately to
improve them, as they are women. They shall be such
as shall not hurt a feature by the austerity of their
reflections, nor cause one impertinent glance by the
wantonness of them. They shall all tend to advance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>the value of their innocence as virgins, improve their
understanding as wives, and regulate their tenderness as
parents. It has been very often said in these Lucubrations,
that the ideas which most frequently pass through
our imaginations, leave traces of themselves in our countenances.
There shall be a strict regard had to this in
my female library, which shall be furnished with nothing
that shall give supplies to ostentation or impertinence;
but the whole shall be so digested for the use of my
students, that they shall not go out of character in their
inquiries, but their knowledge appear only a cultivated
innocence.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Nov. 10.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I was last night visited by a friend<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> of mine who has an
inexhaustible fund of discourse, and never fails to
entertain his company with a variety of thoughts and
hints that are altogether new and uncommon. Whether
it were in complaisance to my way of living, or his real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>opinion, he advanced the following paradox, that it required
much greater talents to fill up and become a
retired life than a life of business. Upon this occasion
he rallied very agreeably the busy men of the age,
who only valued themselves for being in motion, and
passing through a series of trifling and insignificant
actions. In the heat of his discourse, seeing a piece of
money lying on my table, "I defy," says he, "any of
these active persons to produce half the adventures that
this twelvepenny-piece has been engaged in, were it possible
for him to give us an account of his life."</p>

<p>My friend's talk made so odd an impression upon my
mind, that soon after I was a-bed I fell insensibly into a
most unaccountable reverie, that had neither moral nor
design in it, and cannot be so properly called a dream as
a delirium.</p>

<p>Methought the shilling that lay upon the table reared
itself upon its edge, and turning the face towards me,
opened its mouth, and in a soft silver sound gave me the
following account of his life and adventures:</p>

<p>"I was born," says he, "on the side of a mountain,
near a little village of Peru, and made a voyage to
England in an ingot, under the convoy of Sir Francis
Drake. I was, soon after my arrival, taken out of my
Indian habit, refined, naturalised, and put into the British
mode, with the face of Queen Elizabeth on one side, and
the arms of the country on the other. Being thus
equipped, I found in me a wonderful inclination to
ramble, and visit all the parts of the new world into
which I was brought. The people very much favoured
my natural disposition, and shifted me so fast from hand
to hand, that before I was five years old, I had travelled
into almost every corner of the nation. But in the beginning
of my sixth year, to my unspeakable grief, I fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
into the hands of a miserable old fellow, who clapped
me into an iron chest, where I found five hundred more
of my own quality who lay under the same confinement.
The only relief we had, was to be taken out and counted
over in the fresh air every morning and evening. After
an imprisonment of several years, we heard somebody
knocking at our chest, and breaking it open with a
hammer. This we found was the old man's heir, who,
as his father lay a-dying, was so good as to come to our
release: he separated us that very day. What was the
fate of my companions, I know not: as for myself, I was
sent to the apothecary's shop for a pint of sack. The
apothecary gave me to a herb-woman, the herb-woman
to a butcher, the butcher to a brewer, and the brewer to
his wife, who made a present of me to a Nonconformist
preacher. After this manner I made my way merrily
through the world; for, as I told you before, we shillings
love nothing so much as travelling. I sometimes
fetched in a shoulder of mutton, sometimes a play-book,
and often had the satisfaction to treat a Templar at a
twelvepenny ordinary, or carry him with three friends to
Westminster Hall.</p>

<p>"In the midst of this pleasant progress which I made
from place to place, I was arrested by a superstitious old
woman, who shut me up in a greasy purse, in pursuance
of a foolish saying, that while she kept a Queen Elizabeth's
shilling about her, she should never be without
money. I continued here a close prisoner for many
months, till at last I was exchanged for eight-and-forty
farthings.</p>

<p>"I thus rambled from pocket to pocket till the beginning
of the Civil Wars, when, to my shame be it
spoken, I was employed in raising soldiers against the
King; for being of a very tempting breadth, a sergeant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
made use of me to inveigle country fellows, and list
them in the service of the Parliament.</p>

<p>"As soon as he had made one man sure, his way was
to oblige him to take a shilling of a more homely figure,
and then practise the same trick upon another. Thus I
continued doing great mischief to the Crown, till my
officer chancing one morning to walk abroad earlier than
ordinary, sacrificed me to his pleasures, and made use of
me to seduce a milkmaid. This wench bent me, and
gave me to her sweetheart, applying more properly than
she intended the usual form of, 'To my love and from
my love.' This ungenerous gallant marrying her within
few days after, pawned me for a dram of brandy, and
drinking me out next day, I was beaten flat with a
hammer, and again set a-running.</p>

<p>"After many adventures, which it would be tedious
to relate, I was sent to a young spendthrift, in company
with the will of his deceased father. The young fellow,
who I found was very extravagant, gave great demonstrations
of joy at the receiving the will; but opening it, he
found himself disinherited and cut off from the possession
of a fair estate, by virtue of my being made a present
to him. This put him into such a passion, that after
having taken me in his hand, and cursed me, he squirred<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
me away from him as far as he could fling me. I chanced
to light in an unfrequented place under a dead wall, where
I lay undiscovered and useless during the usurpation of
Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p>"About a year after the King's return, a poor cavalier
that was walking there about dinner-time fortunately cast
his eye upon me, and, to the great joy of us both, carried
me to a cook's-shop, where he dined upon me, and drank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the King's health. When I came again into the world, I
found that I had been happier in my retirement than I
thought, having probably by that means escaped wearing
a monstrous pair of breeches.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>"Being now of great credit and antiquity, I was rather
looked upon as a medal than an ordinary coin; for which
reason a gamester laid hold of me, and converted me to
a counter, having got together some dozens of us for
that use. We led a melancholy life in his possession,
being busy at those hours wherein current coin is at rest,
and partaking the fate of our master, being in a few
moments valued at a crown, a pound, or a sixpence,
according to the situation in which the fortune of the
cards placed us. I had at length the good luck to see
my master break, by which means I was again sent abroad
under my primitive denomination of a shilling.</p>

<p>"I shall pass over many other accidents of less moment,
and hasten to that fatal catastrophe when I fell into the
hands of an artist, who conveyed me under ground, and
with an unmerciful pair of shears cut off my titles, clipped
my brims, retrenched my shape, rubbed me to my inmost
ring, and, in short, so spoiled and pillaged me, that he
did not leave me worth a groat. You may think what
a confusion I was in to see myself thus curtailed and disfigured.
I should have been ashamed to have shown my
head, had not all my old acquaintance been reduced to
the same shameful figure, excepting some few that were
punched through the belly. In the midst of this general
calamity, when everybody thought our misfortune irretrievable,
and our case desperate, we were thrown into
the furnace together, and (as it often happens with cities
rising out of a fire) appeared with greater beauty and
lustre than we could ever boast of before. What has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
happened to me since the change of sex which you now
see, I shall take some other opportunity to relate. In
the meantime I shall only repeat two adventures, as being
very extraordinary, and neither of them having ever happened
to me above once in my life. The first was, my
being in a poet's pocket, who was so taken with the
brightness and novelty of my appearance, that it gave
occasion to the finest burlesque poem in the British language,
entitled from me, 'The Splendid Shilling.'<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The
second adventure, which I must not omit, happened to
me in the year 1703, when I was given away in charity
to a blind man; but indeed this was by a mistake, the
person who gave me having heedlessly thrown me into
the hat among a pennyworth of farthings."</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Nov. 13.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I last winter erected a Court of Justice for the correcting
of several enormities in dress and behaviour,
which are not cognisable in any other courts of this
realm. The vintner's case<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> which I there tried is still
fresh in every man's memory. That of the petticoat<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>gave also a general satisfaction, not to mention the more
important points of the cane and perspective;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> in which,
if I did not give judgments and decrees according to the
strictest rules of equity and justice, I can safely say, I
acted according to the best of my understanding. But
as for the proceedings of that court, I shall refer my
reader to an account of them, written by my secretary,
which is now in the press, and will shortly be published
under the title of "Lillie's<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Reports."</p>

<p>As I last year presided over a Court of Justice, it is
my intention this year to set myself at the head of a
Court of Honour. There is no court of this nature
anywhere at present, except in France, where, according
to the best of my intelligence, it consists of such only as
are marshals of that kingdom. I am likewise informed,
that there is not one of that honourable board at present
who has not been driven out of the field by the Duke of
Marlborough; but whether this be only an accidental
or a necessary qualification, I must confess I am not able
to determine.</p>

<p>As for the Court of Honour of which I am here
speaking, I intend to sit myself in it as president, with
several men of honour on my right hand, and women of
virtue on my left, as my assistants. The first place of
the bench I have given to an old Tangerine captain with
a wooden leg. The second is a gentleman of a long
twisted periwig without a curl in it, a muff with very
little hair upon it, and a threadbare coat with new
buttons, being a person of great worth, and second
brother to a man of quality. The third is a gentleman-usher,
extremely well read in romances, and grandson to
one of the greatest wits in Germany, who was some time
master of the ceremonies to the Duke of Wolfembuttel.</p>

<p>As for those who sit farther on my right hand, as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>is usual in public courts, they are such as will fill up the
number of faces upon the bench, and serve rather for
ornament than use.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>The chief upon my left hand are, an old maiden lady, that
preserves some of the best blood of England in her veins.</p>

<p>A Welsh woman of a little stature, but high spirit.</p>

<p>An old prude that has censured every marriage for
these thirty years, and is lately wedded to a young rake.</p>

<p>Having thus furnished my bench, I shall establish
correspondencies with the Horse Guards, and the
veterans of Chelsea College; the former to furnish
me with twelve men of honour as often as I shall have
occasion for a grand jury, and the latter with as many
good men and true for a petty jury.</p>

<p>As for the women of virtue, it will not be difficult
for me to find them about midnight at crimp and basset.</p>

<p>Having given this public notice of my court, I must
further add, that I intend to open it on this day sevennight,
being Monday the twentieth instant; and do
hereby invite all such as have suffered injuries and
affronts that are not to be redressed by the common
laws of this land, whether they be short bows, cold
salutations, supercilious looks, unreturned smiles, distant
behaviour, or forced familiarity; as also all such as have
been aggrieved by any ambiguous expression, accidental
jostle, or unkind repartee; likewise all such as have
been defrauded of their right to the wall, tricked out of
the upper end of the table, or have been suffered to place
themselves in their own wrong on the back seat of the
coach: these, and all of these, I do, as I above said, invite
to bring in their several cases and complaints, in which
they shall be relieved with all imaginable expedition.</p>

<p>I am very sensible, that the office I have now taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
upon me will engage me in the disquisition of many
weighty points that daily perplex the youth of the
British nation, and therefore I have already discussed
several of them for my future use; as, How far a man
may brandish his cane in the telling a story, without
insulting his hearer? What degree of contradiction
amounts to the lie? How a man should resent another's
staring and cocking a hat in his face? If asking pardon
is an atonement for treading upon one's toes? Whether
a man may put up [with] a box on the ear received from
a stranger in the dark? Or, Whether a man of honour
may take a blow off his wife? With several other
subtleties of the like nature.</p>

<p>For my direction in the duties of my office, I have
furnished myself with a certain astrological pair of scales
which I have contrived for this purpose. In one of them
I lay the injuries, in the other the reparations. The
first are represented by little weights made of a metal
resembling iron, and the other in gold. These are not
only lighter than the weights made use of in avoirdupois,
but also than such as are used in troy weight. The
heaviest of those that represent the injuries amount but
to a scruple; and decrease by so many subdivisions, that
there are several imperceptible weights which cannot be
seen without the help of a very fine microscope. I might
acquaint my reader, that these scales were made under
the influence of the sun when he was in Libra, and
describe many signatures on the weights both of injury
and reparation: but as this would look rather to proceed
from an ostentation of my own art than any care for the
public, I shall pass it over in silence.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Nov. 15.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is necessary to an easy and happy life, to possess our
minds in such a manner as to be always well satisfied
with our own reflections. The way to this state is to
measure our actions by our own opinion, and not by that
of the rest of the world. The sense of other men ought
to prevail over us in things of less consideration, but not
in concerns where truth and honour are engaged. When
we look into the bottom of things, what at first appears
a paradox is a plain truth; and those possessions which,
for want of being duly weighed, seem to proceed from a
sort of romantic philosophy, and ignorance of the world,
after a little reflection are so reasonable, that it is direct
madness to walk by any other rules. Thus to contradict
our desires, and to conquer the impulses of our ambition,
if they do not fall in with what we in our inward sentiments
approve, is so much our interest, and so absolutely
necessary to our real happiness, that to contemn all the
wealth and power in the world, where they stand in
competition with a man's honour, is rather good sense
than greatness of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>Did we consider that the mind of a man is the man
himself, we should think it the most unnatural sort of
self-murder to sacrifice the sentiment of the soul to
gratify the appetites of the body. Bless us! Is it
possible, that when the necessities of life are supplied,
a man would flatter to be rich, or circumvent to be
powerful? When we meet a poor wretch urged with
hunger and cold asking an alms, we are apt to think this
a state we could rather starve than submit to: but yet
how much more despicable is his condition who is above
necessity, and yet shall resign his reason and his integrity
to purchase superfluities? These are both abject and
common beggars; but sure it is less despicable to beg a
supply to a man's hunger than his vanity. But custom
and general prepossessions have so far prevailed over an
unthinking world, that those necessitous creatures who
cannot relish life without applause, attendance, and
equipage, are so far from making a contemptible figure,
that distressed virtue is less esteemed than successful
vice. But if a man's appeal in cases that regarded his
honour were made to his own soul, there would be a
basis and standing rule for our conduct, and we should
always endeavour rather to be than appear honourable.
Mr. Collier, in his essay on Fortitude,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> has treated this
subject with great wit and magnanimity. "What," says
he, "can be more honourable than to have courage
enough to execute the commands of reason and conscience;
to maintain the dignity of our nature, and the
station assigned us? To be proof against poverty, pain,
and death itself? I mean so far as not to do anything
that is scandalous or sinful to avoid them? To stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>adversity under all shapes with decency and resolution?
To do this, is to be great above title and fortune. This
argues the soul of a heavenly extraction, and is worthy
the offspring of the Deity."</p>

<p>What a generous ambition has this man pointed to
us? When men have settled in themselves a conviction
by such noble precepts, that there is nothing honourable
that is not accompanied with innocence; nothing mean
but what has guilt in it; I say, when they have attained
thus much, though poverty, pain, and death may still
retain their terrors, yet riches, pleasures, and honours
will easily lose their charms, if they stand between us and
our integrity.</p>

<p>What is here said with allusion to fortune and fame,
may as justly be applied to wit and beauty; for these
latter are as adventitious as the other, and as little concern
the essence of the soul. They are all laudable in
the man who possesses them only for the just application
of them. A bright imagination, while it is subservient
to an honest and noble soul, is a faculty which makes a
man justly admired by mankind, and furnishes him with
reflections upon his own actions, which add delicates to
the feast of a good conscience: but when wit descends to
wait upon sensual pleasures, or promote the base purposes
of ambition, it is then to be contemned in proportion to
its excellence. If a man will not resolve to place the
foundation of his happiness in his own mind, life is a
bewildered and unhappy state, incapable of rest or tranquillity:
for to such a one the general applause of valour,
wit, nay of honesty itself, can give him but a very feeble
comfort, since it is capable of being interrupted by any
one who wants either understanding or good-nature to
see or acknowledge such excellences. This rule is so
necessary, that one may very safely say, it is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
to know any true relish of our being without it. Look
about you in common life among the ordinary race of
mankind, and you will find merit in every kind is allowed
only to those who are in particular districts or sets of
company: but since men can have little pleasure in these
faculties which denominate them persons of distinction,
let them give up such an empty pursuit, and think
nothing essential to happiness but what is in their own
power, the capacity of reflecting with pleasure on their
own actions, however they are interpreted.</p>

<p>It is so evident a truth, that it is only in our own
bosoms we are to search for anything to make us happy,
that it is, methinks, a disgrace to our nature to talk of
the taking our measures from thence only as a matter of
fortitude. When all is well there, the vicissitudes and
distinctions of life are the mere scenes of a drama, and
he will never act his part well who has his thoughts more
fixed upon the applause of the audience than the design
of his part.</p>

<p>The life of a man who acts with a steady integrity,
without valuing the interpretation of his actions, has but
one uniform regular path to move in, where he cannot
meet opposition, or fear ambuscade. On the other side,
the least deviation from the rules of honour introduces
a train of numberless evils, and involves him in inexplicable
mazes. He that has entered into guilt has bid
adieu to rest, and every criminal has his share of the
misery expressed so emphatically in the tragedian:<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Nov. 17.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The following letter, and several others to the same
purpose, accuse me of a rigour of which I am far
from being guilty, to wit, the disallowing the cheerful
use of wine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right">"<em>From my Country-house,<br />

<p class="drop-cap">"Your discourse against drinking, in Tuesday's <cite>Tatler</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
I like well enough in the main; but in my
humble opinion, you are become too rigid where you
say to this effect: 'Were there only this single consideration,
that we are the less masters of ourselves if we
drink the least proportion beyond the exigence of thirst.'
I hope no one drinks wine to allay this appetite. This
seems to be designed for a loftier indulgence of Nature;
for it were hard to suppose, that the Author of Nature,
who imposed upon her her necessities and pains, does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>not allow her her pleasures, and we may reckon among
the latter the moderate use of the grape: and though I
am as much against excess, or whatever approaches it, as
yourself, yet I conceive one may safely go further than
the bounds you there prescribe, not only without forfeiting
the title of being one's own master, but also to
possess it in a much greater degree. If a man's expressing
himself upon any subject with more life and vivacity,
more variety of ideas, more copiously, more fluently, and
more to the purpose, argues it, he thinks clearer, speaks
more ready, and with greater choice of comprehensive
and significant terms. I have the good fortune now to
be intimate with a gentleman remarkable for this temper,
who has an inexhaustible source of wit to entertain the
curious, the grave, the humorous, and the frolic. He
can transform himself into different shapes, and adapt
himself to every company; yet in a coffee-house, or in
the ordinary course of affairs, appears rather dull than
sprightly. You can seldom get him to the tavern, but
when once he is arrived to his pint, and begins to look
about and like his company, you admire a thousand things
in him, which before lay buried. Then you discover the
brightness of his mind and the strength of his judgment,
accompanied with the most graceful mirth. In a word,
by this enlivening aid, he is whatever is polite, instructive,
and diverting. What makes him still more agreeable
is, that he tells a story, serious or comical, with as
much delicacy of humour as Cervantes himself. And
for all this, at other times, even after a long knowledge
of him, you shall scarce discern in this incomparable
person a whit more than what might be expected from
one of a common capacity. Doubtless there are men of
great parts that are guilty of downright bashfulness, that
by a strange hesitation and reluctance to speak, murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the finest and most elegant thoughts, and render the
most lively conceptions flat and heavy.</p>

<p>"In this case, a certain quantity of my white or red
cordial, which you will, is an easy, but an infallible
remedy. It awakens the judgment, quickens memory,
ripens understanding, disperses melancholy, cheers the
heart; in a word, restores the whole man to himself and
his friends without the least pain or indisposition to the
patient. To be taken only in the evening in a reasonable
quantity before going to bed. <em>Note.</em>&mdash;My bottles
are sealed with three fleurs-de-lis and a bunch of grapes.
Beware of counterfeits. I am,</p>

<p class="right">"Your most humble Servant, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Whatever has been said against the use of wine, upon
the supposition that it enfeebles the mind, and renders it
unfit for the duties of life, bears forcibly to the advantage
of that delicious juice, in cases where it only heightens
conversation, and brings to light agreeable talents, which
otherwise would have lain concealed under the oppression
of an unjust modesty. I must acknowledge I have
seen many of the temper mentioned by this correspondent,
and own, wine may very allowably be used in a
degree above the supply of mere necessity by such as
labour under melancholy, or are tongue-tied by modesty.
It is certainly a very agreeable change, when we see a
glass raise a lifeless conversation into all the pleasures
of wit and good-humour. But when Caska adds to his
natural impudence the fluster of a bottle, that which
fools called fire when he was sober, all men abhor as
outrage when he is drunk. Thus he that in the morning
was only saucy, is in the evening tumultuous. It
makes one sick to hear one of these fellows say, they
love a friend and a bottle. Noisy mirth has something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
too rustic in it to be considered without terror by
men of politeness: but while the discourse improves in
a well-chosen company, from the addition of spirits which
flow from moderate cups, it must be acknowledged, that
leisure time cannot be more agreeably, or perhaps more
usefully employed than at such meetings: but there is
a certain prudence in this and all other circumstances
which makes right or wrong in the conduct of ordinary
life. Sir Geoffrey Wildacre has nothing so much at
heart as that his son should know the world betimes:
for this end he introduces him among the sots of his own
age, where the boy learns to laugh at his father from the
familiarity with which he sees him treated by his equals.
This the old fellow calls living well with his heir, and
teaching him to be too much his friend to be impatient
for his estate. But for the more exact regulation of
society in this and other matters, I shall publish tables
of the characters and relations among men, and by them
instruct the town in making sets and companies for a
bottle. This humour of Sir Geoffrey shall be taken
notice of in the first place; for there is, methinks, a sort
of incest in drunkenness, and sons are not to behold
fathers stripped of all reverence.</p>

<p>It is shocking in nature for the young to see those
whom they should have an awe for in circumstances of
contempt. I shall therefore utterly forbid, that those
in whom nature should admonish to avoid too gross
familiarities, shall be received in parties of pleasure
where there is the least danger of excess. I should run
through the whole doctrine of drinking, but that my
thoughts are at present too much employed in the
modelling my Court of Honour; and altering the seats,
benches, bar, and canopy from that of the court wherein
I last winter sat upon causes of less moment. By the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
I shall take an opportunity to examine, what method
is to be taken to make joiners and other artificers get
out of a house they have once entered, not forgetting
to tie them under proper regulations. It is for want
of such rules, that I have a day or two longer than I
expected been tormented and deafened with hammers,
insomuch that I neither can pursue this discourse, or
answer the following and many other letters of the
highest importance.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The court being sat, an oath prepared by the censor
was administered to the assistants on his right
hand, who were all sworn upon their honour. The
women on his left hand took the same oath upon their
reputation. Twelve gentlemen of the Horse Guards were
empanelled, having unanimously chosen Mr. Alexander
Truncheon, who is their right-hand man in the troop,
for their foreman in the jury. Mr. Truncheon immediately
drew his sword, and holding it with the point
towards his own body, presented it to the censor. Mr.
Bickerstaff received it, and after having surveyed the
breadth of the blade, and sharpness of the point, with
more than ordinary attention, returned it to the foreman
in a very graceful manner. The rest of the jury, upon
the delivery of the sword to their foreman, drew all of
them together as one man, and saluted the bench with
such an air, as signified the most resigned submission to
those who commanded them, and the greatest magnanimity
to execute what they should command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bickerstaff, after having received the compliments
on his right hand, cast his eye upon the left, where the
whole female jury paid their respects by a low courtesy,
and by laying their hands upon their mouths. Their
forewoman was a professed Platonist,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> that had spent
much of her time in exhorting the sex to set a just
value upon their persons, and to make the men know
themselves.</p>

<p>There followed a profound silence, when at length,
after some recollection, the censor, who continued
hitherto uncovered, put on his hat with great dignity;
and after having composed the brims of it in a manner
suitable to the gravity of his character, he gave the
following charge, which was received with silence and
attention, that being the only applause which he admits
of, or is ever given in his presence:</p>

<p>"The nature of my office, and the solemnity of this
occasion, requiring that I should open my first session
with a speech, I shall cast what I have to say under two
principal heads.</p>

<p>"Under the first, I shall endeavour to show the
necessity and usefulness of this new-erected court; and
under the second, I shall give a word of advice and
instruction to every constituent part of it.</p>

<p>"As for the first, it is well observed by Ph&aelig;drus, a
heathen poet:</p>

<p class="center"><em>Nisi utile est quod facimus, frustra est gloria.</em><a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
</p>

<p>Which is the same, ladies, as if I should say, It would
be of no reputation for me to be president of a court
which is of no benefit to the public. Now the advantages
that may arise to the weal-public from this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>institution will more plainly appear, if we consider
what it suffers for the want of it. Are not our streets
daily filled with wild pieces of justice and random
penalties? Are not crimes undetermined, and reparations
disproportioned? How often have we seen the
lie punished by death, and the liar himself deciding his
own cause? nay, not only acting the judge, but the
executioner? Have we not known a box on the ear
more severely accounted for than manslaughter? In
these extra-judicial proceedings of mankind, an unmannerly
jest is frequently as capital as a premeditated
murder.</p>

<p>"But the most pernicious circumstance in this case
is, that the man who suffers the injury must put
himself upon the same foot of danger with him that
gave it, before he can have his just revenge; so that
the punishment is altogether accidental, and may fall
as well upon the innocent as the guilty.</p>

<p>"I shall only mention a case which happens frequently
among the more polite nations of the world, and which
I the rather mention, because both sexes are concerned
in it, and which therefore you gentlemen and you ladies
of the jury will the rather take notice of; I mean that
great and known case of cuckoldom. Supposing the
person who has suffered insults in his dearer and better
half; supposing, I say, this person should resent the
injuries done to his tender wife, what is the reparation
he may expect? Why, to be used worse than his poor
lady, run through the body, and left breathless upon
the bed of honour. What then will you on my right
hand say must the man do that is affronted? Must
our sides be elbowed, our shins broken? Must the
wall, or perhaps our mistress, be taken from us? May
a man knit his forehead into a frown, toss up his arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
or pish at what we say, and must the villain live after
it? Is there no redress for injured honour? Yes,
gentlemen, that is the design of the judicature we have
here established.</p>

<p>"A Court of Conscience, we very well know, was first
instituted for the determining of several points of property
that were too little and trivial for the cognisance
of higher courts of justice. In the same manner, our
Court of Honour is appointed for the examination of
several niceties and punctilios that do not pass for
wrongs in the eye of our common laws. But notwithstanding
no legislators of any nation have taken into
consideration these little circumstances, they are such
as often lead to crimes big enough for their inspection,
though they come before them too late for their redress.</p>

<p>"Besides, I appeal to you, ladies [here Mr. Bickerstaff
turned to his left hand], if these are not the little stings
and thorns in life that make it more uneasy than its most
substantial evils? Confess ingenuously, did you never
lose a morning's devotions because you could not offer
them up from the highest place of the pew? Have you
not been in pain, even at a ball, because another has been
taken out to dance before you? Do you love any of
your friends so much as those that are below you? Or
have you any favourites that walk on your right hand?
You have answered me in your looks, I ask no more.</p>

<p>"I come now to the second part of my discourse, which
obliges me to address myself in particular to the respective
members of the court, in which I shall be very brief.</p>

<p>"As for you, gentlemen and ladies, my assistants and
grand juries, I have made choice of you on my right
hand, because I know you very jealous of your honour;
and you on my left, because I know you very much concerned
for the reputation of others; for which reason I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
expect great exactness and impartiality in your verdicts
and judgments.</p>

<p>"I must in the next place address myself to you,
gentlemen of the council: you all know, that I have not
chosen you for your knowledge in the litigious parts of
the law, but because you have all of you formerly fought
duels, of which I have reason to think you have repented,
as being now settled in the peaceable state of benchers.
My advice to you is, only that in your pleadings you are
short and expressive: to which end you are to banish out
of your discourses all synonymous terms, and unnecessary
multiplications of verbs and nouns. I do moreover forbid
you the use of the words 'also' and 'likewise'; and
must further declare, that if I catch any one among you,
upon any pretence whatsoever, using the particle 'or,' I
shall incessantly order him to be stripped of his gown,
and thrown over the bar."</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Nov. 22.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There are no books which I more delight in than in
travels, especially those that describe remote countries,
and give the writer an opportunity of showing his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>parts without incurring any danger of being examined or
contradicted. Among all the authors of this kind, our
renowned countryman Sir John Mandeville<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> has distinguished
himself, by the copiousness of his invention,
and greatness of his genius. The second to Sir John I
take to have been Ferdinand Mendez Pinto,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> a person
of infinite adventure and unbounded imagination. One
reads the voyages of these two great wits with as much
astonishment as the travels of Ulysses in Homer, or of
the Red-Cross Knight in Spenser. All is enchanted
ground and fairy-land.</p>

<p>I have got into my hands by great chance several
manuscripts of these two eminent authors, which are
filled with greater wonders than any of those they have
communicated to the public; and indeed, were they not
so well attested, would appear altogether improbable. I
am apt to think, the ingenious authors did not publish
them with the rest of their works, lest they should pass
for fictions and fables: a caution not unnecessary, when
the reputation of their veracity was not yet established in
the world. But as this reason has now no further weight,
I shall make the public a present of these curious pieces
at such times as I shall find myself unprovided with
other subjects.</p>

<p>The present paper I intend to fill with an extract of
Sir John's journal, in which that learned and worthy
knight gives an account of the freezing and thawing of
several short speeches which he made in the territories of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>Nova Zembla.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> I need not inform my reader, that the
author of "Hudibras" alludes to this strange quality in
that cold climate, when, speaking of abstracted notions
clothed in a visible shape, he adds that apt simile:</p>

<p class="center"><em>Like words congealed in Northern air.</em><a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
</p>

<p>Not to keep my reader any longer in suspense, the
relation put into modern language is as follows:</p>

<p>"We were separated by a storm in the latitude of 73,
insomuch that only the ship which I was in, with a Dutch
and a French vessel, got safe into a creek of Nova Zembla.
We landed, in order to refit our vessels, and store ourselves
with provisions. The crew of each vessel made
themselves a cabin of turf and wood, at some distance
from each other, to fence themselves against the inclemencies
of the weather, which was severe beyond imagination.
We soon observed, that in talking to one another
we lost several of our words, and could not hear one
another at above two yards' distance, and that too when
we sat very near the fire. After much perplexity, I found
that our words froze in the air before they could reach
the ears of the person to whom they were spoken. I was
soon confirmed in this conjecture, when, upon the increase
of the cold, the whole company grew dumb, or
rather deaf; for every man was sensible, as we afterwards
found, that he spoke as well as ever; but the sounds no
sooner took air than they were condensed and lost. It
was now a miserable spectacle to see us nodding and
gaping at one another, every man talking, and no man
heard. One might observe a seaman that could hail a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>ship at a league distance, beckoning with his hands, straining
his lungs, and tearing his throat, but all in vain.</p>

<p class="center"><em>&mdash;&mdash;Nec vox, nec verba, sequuntur.</em><a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
</p>

<p>"We continued here three weeks in this dismal plight.
At length, upon a turn of wind, the air about us began
to thaw. Our cabin was immediately filled with a dry
clattering sound, which I afterwards found to be the
crackling of consonants that broke above our heads, and
were often mixed with a gentle hissing, which I imputed
to the letter S, that occurs so frequently in the English
tongue. I soon after felt a breeze of whispers rushing
by my ear; for those being of a soft and gentle substance,
immediately liquefied in the warm wind that blew across
our cabin. These were soon followed by syllables and
short words, and at length by entire sentences, that
melted sooner or later, as they were more or less congealed;
so that we now heard everything that had been
spoken during the whole three weeks that we had been
silent, if I may use that expression. It was now very
early in the morning, and yet, to my surprise, I heard
somebody say, 'Sir John, it is midnight, and time for
the ship's crew to go to bed.' This I knew to be the
pilot's voice, and upon recollecting myself, I concluded
that he had spoken these words to me some days before,
though I could not hear them before the present thaw.
My reader will easily imagine how the whole crew was
amazed, to hear every man talking, and see no man
opening his mouth. In the midst of this great surprise
we were all in, we heard a volley of oaths and curses,
lasting for a long while, and uttered in a hoarse voice,
which I knew belonged to the boatswain, who was a
very choleric fellow, and had taken his opportunity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
cursing and swearing at me when he thought I could not
hear him; for I had several times given him the strappado
on that account, as I did not fail to repeat it for these
his pious soliloquies when I got him on shipboard.</p>

<p>"I must not omit the names of several beauties in
Wapping, which were heard every now and then, in the
midst of a long sigh that accompanied them; as, 'Dear
Kate!' 'Pretty Mrs. Peggy!' 'When shall I see my
Sue again?' This betrayed several amours which had
been concealed till that time, and furnished us with a
great deal of mirth in our return to England.</p>

<p>"When this confusion of voices was pretty well over,
though I was afraid to offer at speaking, as fearing I
should not be heard, I proposed a visit to the Dutch
cabin, which lay about a mile farther up into the
country. My crew were extremely rejoiced to find they
had again recovered their hearing, though every man
uttered his voice with the same apprehensions that I
had done.</p>

<p class="center"><em>&mdash;&mdash;Et timide verba intermissa retentat.</em><a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
</p>

<p>"At about half a mile's distance from our cabin, we
heard the groanings of a bear, which at first startled us;
but upon inquiry we were informed by some of our
company, that he was dead, and now lay in salt, having
been killed upon that very spot about a fortnight before,
in the time of the frost. Not far from the same place
we were likewise entertained with some posthumous
snarls and barkings of a fox.</p>

<p>"We at length arrived at the little Dutch settlement,
and upon entering the room, found it filled with sighs
that smelt of brandy, and several other unsavoury sounds
that were altogether inarticulate. My valet, who was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Irishman, fell into so great a rage at what he heard, that
he drew his sword; but not knowing where to lay the
blame, he put it up again. We were stunned with these
confused noises, but did not hear a single word till about
half-an-hour after; which I ascribed to the harsh and
obdurate sounds of that language, which wanted more
time than ours to melt and become audible.</p>

<p>"After having here met with a very hearty welcome,
we went to the French cabin, who, to make amends for
their three weeks' silence, were talking and disputing
with greater rapidity and confusion than ever I heard in
an assembly even of that nation. Their language as I
found, upon the first giving of the weather, fell asunder
and dissolved. I was here convinced of an error into
which I had before fallen; for I fancied, that for the
freezing of the sound, it was necessary for it to be
wrapped up, and, as it were, preserved in breath; but I
found my mistake, when I heard the sound of a kit
playing a minuet over our heads. I asked the occasion
of it; upon which one of the company told me, that
it would play there above a week longer if the thaw
continued; 'for,' says he, 'finding ourselves bereft of
speech, we prevailed upon one of the company, who had
this musical instrument about him, to play to us from
morning to night; all which time we employed in dancing,
in order to dissipate our chagrin, <i lang="fr">et tuer le temps</i>.'"</p>

<p>Here Sir John gives very good philosophical reasons
why the kit could be heard during the frost; but as
they are something prolix, I pass them over in silence,
and shall only observe, that the honourable author seems,
by his quotations, to have been well versed in the ancient
poets, which perhaps raised his fancy above the ordinary
pitch of historians, and very much contributed to the
embellishment of his writings.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I am at present under very great difficulties, which it
is not in the power of any one, besides yourself, to
redress. Whether or no you shall think it a proper case
to come before your Court of Honour, I cannot tell; but
thus it is: I am chaplain to an honourable family, very
regular at the hours of devotion, and I hope of an
unblamable life; but for not offering to rise at a second
course, I found my patron and his lady very sullen and
out of humour, though at first I did not know the reason
of it. At length, when I happened to help myself to a
jelly, the lady of the house, otherwise a devout woman,
told me, that it did not become a man of my cloth to
delight in such frivolous food: but as I still continued
to sit out the last course, I was yesterday informed by
the butler, that his lordship had no further occasion for
my service. All which is humbly submitted to your
consideration by,</p>

<p>The case of this gentleman deserves pity, especially
if he loves sweetmeats, to which, if I may guess by his
letter, he is no enemy. In the meantime, I have often
wondered at the indecency of discarding the holiest man
from the table as soon as the most delicious parts of the
entertainment are served up, and could never conceive a
reason for so absurd a custom. Is it because a liquorish
palate or a sweet tooth (as they call it) is not consistent
with the sanctity of his character? This is but a trifling
pretence. No man of the most rigid virtue gives offence
by any excesses in plum-pudding or plum-porridge, and
that, because they are the first parts of the dinner. Is
there anything that tends to incitation in sweetmeats more
than in ordinary dishes? Certainly not. Sugar-plums
are a very innocent diet, and conserves of a much colder
nature than your common pickles. I have sometimes
thought that the ceremony of the chaplain's flying away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>from the dessert was typical and figurative, to mark out
to the company how they ought to retire from all the
luscious baits of temptation, and deny their appetites the
gratifications that are most pleasing to them; or at least
to signify, that we ought to stint ourselves in our most
lawful satisfactions, and not make our pleasure, but our
support, the end of eating: but most certainly, if such a
lesson of temperance had been necessary at a table, our
clergy would have recommended it to all the lay-masters
of families, and not have disturbed other men's tables
with such unseasonable examples of abstinence. The
original, therefore, of this barbarous custom I take to
have been merely accidental. The chaplain retired out
of pure complaisance to make room for the removal of
the dishes, or possibly for the ranging of the dessert.
This by degrees grew into a duty, till at length, as the
fashion improved, the good man found himself cut off
from the third part of the entertainment; and if the
arrogance of the patron goes on, it is not impossible but,
in the next generation, he may see himself reduced to
the tithe, or tenth dish of the table; a sufficient caution
not to part with any privilege we are once possessed of.
It was usual for the priest in old times to feast upon the
sacrifice, nay the honey-cake, while the hungry laity looked
upon him with great devotion, or as the late Lord
Rochester describes it in a very lively manner:</p>

<p class="center"><em>And while the priest did eat, the people stared.</em>
</p>

<p>At present the custom is inverted; the laity feast, while
the priest stands by as a humble spectator. This necessarily
puts the good man upon making great ravages on
all the dishes that stand near him, and distinguishing
himself by voraciousness of appetite, as knowing that his
time is short. I would fain ask these stiff-necked patrons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
whether they would not take it ill of a chaplain that, in
his grace after meat, should return thanks for the whole
entertainment, with an exception to the dessert? And
yet I cannot but think, that in such a proceeding he
would but deal with them as they deserved. What would
a Roman Catholic priest think, who is always helped
first, and placed next the ladies, should he see a clergyman
giving his company the slip at the first appearance of
the tarts or sweetmeats? Would not he believe that he
had the same antipathy to a candied orange, or a piece of
puff-paste, as some have to a Cheshire cheese, or a breast
of mutton? Yet to so ridiculous a height is this foolish
custom grown, that even the Christmas pie, which in its
very nature is a kind of consecrated cate, and a badge of
distinction, is often forbidden to the Druid of the family.
Strange! that a sirloin of beef, whether boiled or roasted,
when entire, is exposed to his utmost depredations and
incisions; but if minced into small pieces, and tossed
up with plums and sugar, changes its property, and, forsooth,
is meat for his master.</p>

<p>In this case I know not which to censure, the patron
or the chaplain, the insolence of power, or the abjectness
of dependence. For my own part, I have often blushed
to see a gentleman, whom I knew to have much more
wit and learning than myself, and who was bred up with
me at the University upon the same foot of a liberal
education, treated in such an ignominious manner, and
sunk beneath those of his own rank, by reason of that
character which ought to bring him honour. This deters
men of generous minds from placing themselves in such
a station of life, and by that means frequently excludes
persons of quality from the improving and agreeable
conversation of a learned and obsequious friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Oldham lets us know, that he was affrighted from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>

<p><a name="Footnote_207_207" id="Footnote_207_207"></a><a href="#FNanchor_207_207"><span class="label">[207]</span></a> Mr. Overton, in his "Life in the English Church, 1660-1714,"
denies the truth of Macaulay's account of the condition of the clergy.
He points out that the sons of many noble families were in the
Church, and many clergymen of the highest standing were once
domestic chaplains. But there was much "contempt of the clergy,"
as Eachard puts it, in his book published in 1670. Many enjoyed
pluralities, which, of course, meant that a larger number than would
otherwise have been the case were poor all their lives. Swift wrote:
"I never dined with the chaplains till to-day; but my friend Gastrel
and the Dean of Rochester had often invited me, and I happened to
be disengaged: it is the worst provided table at court. We ate on
pewter. Every chaplain, when he is made a dean, gives a piece of
plate, and so they have got a little, some of it very old" ("Journal,"
October 6, 1711). See, too, Swift's "Project for the Advancement
of Religion," and "Directions to the Waiting-Maid." Many private
chaplains had salaries of &pound;10 to &pound;30 a year, with vales, and were
called Mess Johns, trencher chaplains, and young Levites (Lecky's
"History of England in the Eighteenth Century," i. 77, 78). Bishop
Bramhall replied to Eachard in 1671, in "An Answer to a Letter
of Inquiry," &amp;c., and said that some gentlemen, at any rate, treated
their chaplains with all proper respect. Edward Chamberlayne, on
the other hand, in his "Angli&aelig; Notitia" (1669), said that men thought
it a stain to their blood to make their sons clergymen, and that women
were ashamed to marry with any of them.</p></div>

<h3>The Proceedings of the Court of Honour, held in Sheer
Lane, on Monday, the 20th of November, 1710,
before <span class="smcap">Isaac Bickerstaff</span>, Esq., Censor of Great
Britain.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Peter Plumb, of London, merchant, was indicted by
the Honourable Mr. Thomas Gules,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> of Gule Hall,
in the county of Salop, for that the said Peter Plumb did
in Lombard Street, London, between the hours of two
and three in the afternoon, meet the said Mr. Thomas
Gules, and after a short salutation, put on his hat, value
fivepence, while the Honourable Mr. Gules stood bareheaded
for the space of two seconds. It was further
urged against the criminal, that during his discourse with
the prosecutor, he feloniously stole the wall of him,
having clapped his back against it in such a manner that
it was impossible for Mr. Gules to recover it again at
his taking leave of him. The prosecutor alleged, that
he was the cadet of a very ancient family; and that
according to the principles of all the younger brothers
of the said family, he had never sullied himself with
business, but had chosen rather to starve like a man of
honour than do anything beneath his quality. He produced
several witnesses, that he had never employed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>himself beyond the twisting of a whip, or the making of
a pair of nut-crackers, in which he only worked for his
diversion, in order to make a present now and then to
his friends. The prisoner being asked what he could say
for himself, cast several reflections upon the Honourable
Mr. Gules: as, that he was not worth a groat;
that nobody in the city would trust him for a halfpenny;
that he owed him money, which he had promised to
pay him several times, but never kept his word; and in
short, that he was an idle, beggarly fellow, and of no use
to the public. This sort of language was very severely
reprimanded by the Censor, who told the criminal, that
he spoke in contempt of the court, and that he should
be proceeded against for contumacy if he did not change
his style. The prisoner therefore desired to be heard by
his counsel, who urged in his defence, that he put on his
hat through ignorance, and took the wall by accident.
They likewise produced several witnesses, that he made
several motions with his hat in his hand, which are generally
understood as an invitation to the person we talk
with to be covered; and that the gentleman not taking
the hint, he was forced to put on his hat, as being
troubled with a cold. There was likewise an Irishman
who deposed, that he had heard him cough three and
twenty times that morning. And as for the wall, it was
alleged that he had taken it inadvertently to save himself
from a shower of rain which was then falling. The
Censor having consulted the men of honour who sat at
his right hand on the bench, found they were all of
opinion, that the defence made by the prisoner's counsel
did rather aggravate than extenuate his crime; that the
motions and intimations of the hat were a token of
superiority in conversation, and therefore not to be used
by the criminal to a man of the prosecutor's quality, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
was likewise vested with a double title to the wall at the
time of their conversation, both as it was the upper hand,
and as it was a shelter from the weather. The evidence
being very full and clear, the jury, without going out of
court, declared their opinion unanimously by the mouth
of their foreman, that the prosecutor was bound in
honour to make the sun shine through the criminal, or,
as they afterwards explained themselves, to whip him
through the lungs.</p>

<p>The Censor knitting his brows into a frown, and looking
very sternly upon the jury, after a little pause, gave
them to know, that this court was erected for the finding
out of penalties suitable to offences, and to restrain the
outrages of private justice; and that he expected they
should moderate their verdict. The jury therefore retired,
and being willing to comply with the advices of
the Censor, after an hour's consultation, declared their
opinion as follows:</p>

<p>"That in consideration this was Peter Plumb's first
offence, and that there did not appear any <em>malice prepense</em>
in it, as also that he lived in good reputation among his
neighbours, and that his taking the wall was only <em>se</em>
<em>defendendo</em>, the prosecutor should let him escape with
life, and content himself with the slitting of his nose, and
the cutting off both his ears."</p>

<p>Mr. Bickerstaff smiling upon the court, told them, that
he thought the punishment, even under its present mitigation,
too severe; and that such penalties might be of
ill consequence in a trading nation. He therefore pronounced
sentence against the criminal in the following

should be forfeited to the court; that the criminal should

Garraway's Coffee-house, in what manner he pleased;
but that neither he nor any of the family of the Plumbs

<p>Dathan, a peddling Jew, and T.R., a Welshman, were
indicted by the keeper of an alehouse in Westminster,
for breaking the peace and two earthen mugs, in a dispute
about the antiquity of their families, to the great
detriment of the house, and disturbance of the whole
neighbourhood. Dathan said for himself, that he was
provoked to it by the Welshman, who pretended that
the Welsh were an ancienter people than the Jews;
"whereas," says he, "I can show by this genealogy in my
hand, that I am the son of Meshec, that was the son of
Naboth, that was the son of Shalem, that was the son
of&mdash;&mdash;" The Welshman here interrupted him, and told
him that he could produce shennalogy as well as himself;
for that he was John ap Rice, ap Shenkin, ap Shones.
He then turned himself to the Censor, and told him in
the same broken accent, and with much warmth, that
the Jew would needs uphold that King Cadwallader was
younger than Issachar. Mr. Bickerstaff seemed very
much inclined to give sentence against Dathan, as being
a Jew, but finding reasons, by some expressions which
the Welshman let fall in asserting the antiquity of his
family, to suspect that the said Welshman was a Pre-Adamite,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
he suffered the jury to go out without any
previous admonition. After some time they returned,
and gave their verdict, that it appearing the persons at
the bar did neither of them wear a sword, and that consequently
they had no right to quarrel upon a point of
honour: to prevent such frivolous appeals for the future,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>they should both of them be tossed in the same blanket,
and there adjust the superiority as they could agree
it between themselves. The Censor confirmed the
verdict.</p>

<p>Richard Newman was indicted by Major Punto, for
having used the words, "Perhaps it may be so," in a
dispute with the said Major. The Major urged, that
the word "perhaps" was questioning his veracity, and
that it was an indirect manner of giving him the lie.
Richard Newman had nothing more to say for himself,
than that he intended no such thing, and threw himself
upon the mercy of the court. The jury brought in their
verdict special.</p>

<p>Mr. Bickerstaff stood up, and after having cast his
eyes over the whole assembly, hem'd thrice. He then
acquainted them, that he had laid down a rule to himself,
which he was resolved never to depart from, and
which, as he conceived, would very much conduce to the
shortening the business of the court; "I mean," says he,
"never to allow of the lie being given by construction,
implication, or induction, but by the sole use of the
word itself." He then proceeded to show the great
mischiefs that had arisen to the English nation from
that pernicious monosyllable; that it had bred the most
fatal quarrels between the dearest friends; that it had
frequently thinned the Guards, and made great havoc
in the army; that it had sometimes weakened the city
trained-bands; and, in a word, had destroyed many of
the bravest men in the isle of Great Britain. For the
prevention of which evils for the future, he instructed
the jury to present the word itself as a nuisance in the
English tongue; and further promised them, that he
would, upon such their presentment, publish an edict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
of the court for the entire banishment and exclusion of
it out of the discourses and conversation of all civil
societies.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Nov. 29.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Every nation is distinguished by productions that are
peculiar to it. Great Britain is particularly fruitful
in religions, that shoot up and flourish in this climate
more than in any other. We are so famous abroad for
our great variety of sects and opinions, that an ingenious
friend of mine, who is lately returned from his travels,
assures me, there is a show at this time carried up and
down in Germany, which represents all the religions of
Great Britain in waxwork. Notwithstanding that the
pliancy of the matter in which the images are wrought
makes it capable of being moulded into all shapes and
figures, my friend tells me, that he did not think it
possible for it to be twisted and tortured into so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
screwed faces and wry features as appeared in several of
the figures that composed the show. I was indeed so
pleased with the design of the German artist, that I
begged my friend to give me an account of it in all its
particulars, which he did after the following manner:</p>

<p>"I have often," says he, "been present at a show
of elephants, camels, dromedaries, and other strange
creatures, but I never saw so great an assembly of spectators
as were met together at the opening of this great
piece of waxwork. We were all placed in a large hall,
according to the price that we had paid for our seats.
The curtain that hung before the show was made by a
master of tapestry, who had woven it in the figure of a
monstrous hydra that had several heads, which brandished
out their tongues, and seemed to hiss at each other.
Some of these heads were large and entire; and where
any of them had been lopped away, there sprouted up
several in the room of them; insomuch that for one
head cut off, a man might see ten, twenty, or a hundred
of a smaller size, creeping through the wound. In
short, the whole picture was nothing but confusion and
bloodshed. On a sudden," says my friend, "I was
startled with a flourish of many musical instruments that
I had never heard before, which was followed by a short
tune (if it might be so called), wholly made up of jars and
discords. Among the rest, there was an organ, a bagpipe,
a groaning-board,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> a stentorophonic-trumpet, with
several wind instruments of a most disagreeable sound,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>which I do not so much as know the name of. After a
short flourish, the curtain was drawn up, and we were
presented with the most extraordinary assembly of figures
that ever entered into a man's imagination. The design
of the workman was so well expressed in the dumb show
before us, that it was not hard for an Englishman to
comprehend the meaning of it.</p>

<p>"The principal figures were placed in a row, consisting
of seven persons. The middle figure, which immediately
attracted the eyes of the whole company, and was much
bigger than the rest, was formed like a matron, dressed
in the habit of an elderly woman of quality in Queen
Elizabeth's days. The most remarkable parts of her
dress was the beaver with the steeple crown, the scarf
that was darker than sable, and the lawn apron that was
whiter than ermine. Her gown was of the richest black
velvet, and just upon her heart studded with large
diamonds of an inestimable value, disposed in the form
of a cross. She bore an inexpressible cheerfulness and
dignity in her aspect; and though she seemed in years,
appeared with so much spirit and vivacity, as gave her
at the same time an air of old age and immortality. I
found my heart touched with so much love and reverence
at the sight of her, that the tears ran down my face as I
looked upon her; and still the more I looked upon her,
the more my heart was melted with the sentiments of
filial tenderness and duty. I discovered every moment
something so charming in this figure, that I could scarce
take my eyes off it. On its right hand there sat the
figure of a woman so covered with ornaments, that her
face, her body, and her hands were almost entirely hid
under them. The little you could see of her face was
painted; and what I thought very odd, had something
in it like artificial wrinkles; but I was the less surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
at it when I saw upon her forehead an old-fashioned
tower of grey hairs. Her head-dress rose very high by
three several storeys or degrees; her garments had a
thousand colours in them, and were embroidered with
crosses in gold, silver and silk: she had nothing on, so
much as a glove or a slipper, which was not marked with
this figure; nay, so superstitiously fond did she appear
of it, that she sat cross-legged. I was quickly sick of
this tawdry composition of ribands, silks, and jewels, and
therefore cast my eye on a dame which was just the
reverse of it. I need not tell my reader, that the lady
before described was Popery, or that she I am now going
to describe is Presbytery. She sat on the left hand of
the venerable matron, and so much resembled her in the
features of her countenance, that she seemed her sister;
but at the same time that one observed a likeness in her
beauty, one could not but take notice, that there was
something in it sickly and splenetic. Her face had
enough to discover the relation, but it was drawn up
into a peevish figure, soured with discontent, and overcast
with melancholy. She seemed offended at the
matron for the shape of her hat, as too much resembling
the triple coronet of the person who sat by her.
One might see likewise, that she dissented from the
white apron and the cross; for which reasons she had
made herself a plain, homely dowdy, and turned her face
towards the sectaries that sat on her left hand, as being
afraid of looking upon the matron, lest she should see
the harlot by her.</p>

<p>"On the right hand of Popery sat Judaism, represented
by an old man embroidered with phylacteries, and distinguished
by many typical figures, which I had not skill
enough to unriddle. He was placed among the rubbish
of a temple; but instead of weeping over it (which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
should have expected from him), he was counting out
a bag of money upon the ruins of it.</p>

<p>"On his right hand was Deism, or natural religion.
This was a figure of a half-naked, awkward country
wench, who with proper ornaments and education would
have made an agreeable and beautiful appearance; but
for want of those advantages, was such a spectacle as a
man would blush to look upon.</p>

<p>"I have now," continued my friend, "given you an
account of those who were placed on the right hand of
the matron, and who, according to the order in which
they sat, were Deism, Judaism, and Popery. On the left
hand, as I told you, appeared Presbytery. The next to
her was a figure which somewhat puzzled me: it was
that of a man looking, with horror in his eyes, upon
a silver basin filled with water. Observing something
in his countenance that looked like lunacy, I fancied at
first that he was to express that kind of distraction which
the physicians call the hydrophobia; but considering what
the intention of the show was, I immediately recollected
myself, and concluded it to be Anabaptism.</p>

<p>"The next figure was a man that sat under a most
profound composure of mind: he wore a hat whose
brims were exactly parallel with the horizon: his garment
had neither sleeve nor skirt, nor so much as a
superfluous button. What they called his cravat, was
a little piece of white linen quilled with great exactness,
and hanging below his chin about two inches.
Seeing a book in his hand, I asked our artist what it
was, who told me it was the Quaker's religion; upon
which I desired a sight of it. Upon perusal, I found it
to be nothing but a new-fashioned grammar, or an art
of abridging ordinary discourse. The nouns were reduced
to a very small number, as the 'light,' 'friend,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
'Babylon.' The principal of his pronouns was 'thou';
and as for 'you,' 'ye,' and 'yours,' I found they were
not looked upon as parts of speech in this grammar.
All the verbs wanted the second person plural; the
participles ended all in 'ing' or 'ed,' which were
marked with a particular accent. There were no adverbs
besides 'yea' and 'nay.' The same thrift was
observed in the prepositions. The conjunctions were only
'hem!' and 'ha!' and the interjections brought under
the three heads of 'sighing,' 'sobbing,' and 'groaning.'</p>

<p>"There was at the end of the grammar a little nomenclature,
called 'The Christian Man's Vocabulary,' which
gave new appellations, or (if you will) Christian names,
to almost everything in life. I replaced the book in the
hand of the figure, not without admiring the simplicity
of its garb, speech, and behaviour.</p>

<p>"Just opposite to this row of religions, there was a
statue dressed in a fool's coat, with a cap of bells upon
his head, laughing and pointing at the figures that stood
before him. This idiot is supposed to say in his heart
what David's fool did some thousands of years ago, and
was therefore designed as a proper representative of those
among us who are called atheists and infidels by others,
and free-thinkers by themselves.</p>

<p>"There were many other groups of figures which I
did not know the meaning of; but seeing a collection of
both sexes turning their backs upon the company, and
laying their heads very close together, I inquired after
their religion, and found that they called themselves the
Philadelphians, or the Family of Love.</p>

<p>"In the opposite corner there sat another little congregation
of strange figures, opening their mouths as
wide as they could gape, and distinguished by the title
of the Sweet Singers of Israel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must not omit, that in this assembly of wax there
were several pieces that moved by clockwork, and gave
great satisfaction to the spectators. Behind the matron
there stood one of these figures, and behind Popery
another, which, as the artist told us, were each of them
the genius of the person they attended. That behind
Popery represented Persecution, and the other Moderation.
The first of these moved by secret springs towards
a great heap of dead bodies that lay piled upon one
another at a considerable distance behind the principal
figures. There were written on the foreheads of these
dead men several hard words, as 'Pre-Adamites, 'Sabbatarians,'
'Cameronians,' 'Muggletonians,' 'Brownists,'
'Independents,' 'Masonites,' 'Camisards,' and the like.
At the approach of Persecution, it was so contrived, that
as she held up her bloody flag, the whole assembly of
dead men, like those in the 'Rehearsal,'<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> started up and
drew their swords. This was followed by great clashings
and noise, when, in the midst of the tumult, the
figure of Moderation moved gently towards this new
army, which upon her holding up a paper in her hand,
inscribed, 'Liberty of Conscience,' immediately fell into
a heap of carcasses, remaining in the same quiet posture
that they lay at first."</p>

to my bright beaver and shining scarf that were new that
day. But I was still more astonished to find such an
agreeable change at the table: my lord helped me to a
fat slice of venison with his own hand, and my lady did
me the honour to drink to me. I offered to rise at my
usual time, but was desired to sit still, with this kind
expression, 'Come, doctor, a jelly or a conserve will do
you no harm; don't be afraid of the dessert.' I was so
confounded with the favour, that I returned my thanks
in a most awkward manner, wondering what was the
meaning of this total transformation: but my lord soon
put an end to my admiration, by showing me a paper
that challenged you, sir, for its author, and rallied me
very agreeably on the subject, asking me, which was best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>handled, the lord or his chaplain? I owned myself to
think the banter sharpest against ourselves, and that
these were trifling matters, not fit for a philosopher to
insist on. His lordship was in so good a humour, that
he ordered me to return his thanks with my own, and my
lady joins in the same, with this one exception to your
paper, that the chaplain in her family was always allowed
mince-pies from All-Hallows to Candlemas. I am,</p>

<p>A Continuation of the Journal of the Court of Honour,
held in Sheer Lane, on Monday, the 27th of November,
before <span class="smcap">Isaac Bickerstaff</span>, Esq., Censor of
Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">Elizabeth Makebate,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> of the parish of St. Catherine's,
spinster, was indicted for surreptitiously taking
away the hassock from under the Lady Grave-Airs,
between the hours of four and five, on Sunday the 26th
of November. The prosecutor deposed, that as she
stood up to make a curtsey to a person of quality in
a neighbouring pew, the criminal conveyed away the
hassock by stealth, insomuch that the prosecutor was
obliged to sit all the while she was at church, or to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>her prayers in a posture that did not become a woman
of her quality. The prisoner pleaded inadvertency; and
the jury were going to bring it in chance-medley, had
not several witnesses been produced against the said
Elizabeth Makebate, that she was an old offender, and
a woman of a bad reputation. It appeared in particular,
that on the Sunday before she had detracted from a new
petticoat of Mrs. Mary Doelittle, having said in the
hearing of several credible witnesses, that the said petticoat
was scoured,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> to the great grief and detriment of
the said Mary Doelittle. There were likewise many
evidences produced against the criminal, that though
she never failed to come to church on Sunday, she was
a most notorious Sabbath-breaker, and that she spent
her whole time, during divine service, in disparaging
other people's clothes, and whispering to those who sat
next her. Upon the whole, she was found guilty of the
indictment, and received sentence to ask pardon of the
prosecutor upon her bare knees, without either cushion
or hassock under her, in the face of the court.</p>

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;As soon as the sentence was executed on the
criminal, which was done in open court with the utmost
severity, the first lady of the bench on Mr. Bickerstaff's
right hand stood up, and made a motion to the court,
that whereas it was impossible for women of fashion to
dress themselves before the church was half done, and
whereas many confusions and inconveniences did arise
thereupon, it might be lawful for them to send a footman,
in order to keep their places, as was usual in other
polite and well-regulated assemblies.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The motion was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>ordered to be entered in the books, and considered at
a more convenient time.</p>

<p>Charles Cambric, linen-draper, in the city of Westminster,
was indicted for speaking obscenely to the Lady
Penelope Touchwood. It appeared, that the prosecutor
and her woman going in a stage-coach from London to
Brentford, where they were to be met by the lady's own
chariot, the criminal and another of his acquaintance
travelled with them in the same coach, at which time
the prisoner talked bawdy for the space of three miles
and a half. The prosecutor alleged that over against
the Old Fox at Knightsbridge he mentioned the word
"linen"; that at the farther end of Kensington he made
use of the term "smock"; and that before he came to
Hammersmith, he talked almost a quarter of an hour
upon wedding-shifts. The prosecutor's woman confirmed
what her lady had said, and added further, that
she had never seen her lady in so great a confusion, and
in such a taking, as she was during the whole discourse
of the criminal. The prisoner had little to say for himself,
but that he talked only in his own trade, and meant
no hurt by what he said. The jury, however, found him
guilty, and represented by their forewoman, that such
discourses were apt to sully the imagination, and that
by a concatenation of ideas, the word "linen" implied
many things that were not proper to be stirred up in the
mind of a woman who was of the prosecutor's quality,
and therefore gave it as their verdict, that the linen-draper
should lose his tongue. Mr. Bickerstaff said, he
thought the prosecutor's ears were as much to blame as
the prisoner's tongue, and therefore gave sentence as
follows: that they should both be placed over against
one another in the middle of the court, there to remain
for the space of one quarter of an hour, during which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
time the linen-draper was to be gagged, and the lady to
hold her hands close upon both her ears, which was
executed accordingly.</p>

<p>Edward Callicot was indicted as an accomplice to
Charles Cambric, for that he, the said Edward Callicot,
did, by his silence and his smiles, seem to approve and
abet the said Charles Cambric in everything he said.
It appeared, that the prisoner was foreman of the shop
to the aforesaid Charles Cambric, and by his post
obliged to smile at everything that the other should
be pleased to say: upon which he was acquitted.</p>

<p>Josias Shallow was indicted in the name of Dame
Winifred, sole relict of Richard Dainty, Esq., for having
said several times in company, and in the hearing of
several persons there present, that he was extremely
obliged to the widow Dainty, and that he should never
be able sufficiently to express his gratitude. The prosecutor
urged that this might blast her reputation, and
that it was in effect a boasting of favours which he
had never received. The prisoner seemed to be much
astonished at the construction which was put upon his
words, and said that he meant nothing by them, but
that the widow had befriended him in a lease, and was
very kind to his younger sister. The jury finding him
a little weak in his understanding, without going out of
the court, brought in their verdict Ignoramus.</p>

<p>Ursula Goodenough was accused by the Lady Betty
Wouldbe, for having said that she, the Lady Betty
Wouldbe, was painted. The prisoner brought several
persons of good credit to witness to her reputation,
and proved by undeniable evidences, that she was never
at the place where the words were said to have been
uttered. The Censor observing the behaviour of the
prosecutor, found reason to believe that she had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>dicted
the prisoner for no other reason but to make
her complexion be taken notice of, which indeed was
very fresh and beautiful: he therefore asked the offender
with a very stern voice, how she could presume
to spread so groundless a report? and whether she saw
any colours in the Lady Wouldbe's face that could procure
credit to such a falsehood? "Do you see," says he,
"any lilies or roses in her cheeks, any bloom, any probability&mdash;&mdash;"
The prosecutor, not able to bear such
language any longer, told him, that he talked like a
blind old fool, and that she was ashamed to have entertained
any opinion of his wisdom: but she was soon
put to silence, and sentenced to wear her mask for five
months, and not to presume to show her face till the
town should be empty.</p>

<p>Benjamin Buzzard, Esq., was indicted for having told
the Lady Everbloom at a public ball, that she looked
very well for a woman of her years. The prisoner not
denying the fact, and persisting before the court that he
looked upon it as a compliment, the jury brought him
in <i lang="la">non compos mentis</i>.</p>

instrument of derision, and which they were used to
cock, toss, or draw up in a contemptuous manner, upon
reading the works of their ingenious contemporaries. It
is not therefore for this generation of men that I write

</div></div></div>

<p>but for the sake of some of my philosophical friends in
the Royal Society, who peruse discourses of this nature
with a becoming gravity, and a desire of improving by
them.</p>

<p>Many are the opinions of learned men concerning the
rise of that fatal distemper which has always taken a
particular pleasure in venting its spite upon the nose.
I have seen a little burlesque poem in Italian that gives
a very pleasant account of this matter. The fable of it
runs thus: Mars, the god of war, having served during
the siege of Naples in the shape of a French colonel,
received a visit one night from Venus, the goddess of
love, who had been always his professed mistress and
admirer. The poem says, she came to him in the disguise
of a sutling wench, with a bottle of brandy under
her arm. Let that be as it will, he managed matters so
well, that she went away big-bellied, and was at length
brought to bed of a little Cupid. This boy, whether it
were by reason of any bad food that his father had eaten
during the siege, or of any particular malignity in the
stars that reigned at his nativity, came into the world
with a very sickly look and crazy constitution. As soon
as he was able to handle his bow, he made discoveries of
a most perverse disposition. He dipped all his arrows
in poison, that rotted everything they touched; and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
was more particular, aimed all his shafts at the nose,
quite contrary to the practice of his elder brothers, who
had made a human heart their butt in all countries and
ages. To break him of this roguish trick, his parents
put him to school to Mercury, who did all he could to
hinder him from demolishing the noses of mankind; but
in spite of education the boy continued very unlucky;
and though his malice was a little softened by good
instructions, he would very frequently let fly an envenomed
arrow, and wound his votaries oftener in the
nose than in the heart. Thus far the fable.</p>

<p>I need not tell my learned reader that Correggio has
drawn a Cupid taking his lesson from Mercury, conformable
to this poem; nor that the poem itself was designed
as a burlesque upon Fracastorius.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>It was a little after this fatal siege of Naples that
Talicotius<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> began to practise in a town of Germany. He
was the first clap doctor that I meet with in history, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>a greater man in his age than our celebrated Dr. Wall.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
He saw this species extremely mutilated and disfigured
by this new distemper that was crept into it; and therefore,
in pursuance of a very seasonable invention, set up
a manufacture of noses, having first got a patent that
none should presume to make noses besides himself. His
first patient was a great man of Portugal, who had done
good services to his country, but in the midst of them
unfortunately lost his nose. Talicotius grafted a new
one on the remaining part of the gristle or cartilaginous
substance, which would sneeze, smell, take snuff, pronounce
the letters <em>m</em> or <em>n</em>, and, in short, do all the
functions of a genuine and natural nose. There was,
however, one misfortune in this experiment. The Portuguese's
complexion was a little upon the subfusk, with
very black eyes and dark eyebrows, and the nose being
taken from a porter that had a white German skin, and
cut out of those parts that are not exposed to the sun, it
was very visible that the features of his face were not
fellows. In a word, the Comd&egrave; resembled one of those
maimed antique statues that has often a modern nose
of fresh marble glued to a face of such a yellow ivory
complexion as nothing can give but age. To remedy
this particular for the future, the doctor got together a
great collection of porters, men of all complexions, black,
brown, fair, dark, sallow, pale, and ruddy; so that it
was impossible for a patient of the most out-of-the-way
colour not to find a nose to match it.</p>

<p>The doctor's house was now very much enlarged, and
became a kind of college, or rather hospital, for the
fashionable cripples of both sexes that resorted to him
from all parts of Europe. Over his door was fastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
a large golden snout, not unlike that which is placed
over the great gates at Brasenose College, in Oxford;
and as it is usual for the learned in foreign universities
to distinguish their houses by a Latin sentence, the
doctor writ underneath this great golden proboscis two
verses out of Ovid:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Militat omnis amans, habet et sua castra Cupido,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>Pontice, crede mihi, militat omnis amans.</em><a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is reported, that Talicotius had at one time in his
house twelve German counts, nineteen French marquises,
and a hundred Spanish cavaliers, besides one
solitary English esquire, of whom more hereafter.
Though the doctor had the monopoly of noses in his
own hands, he is said not to have been unreasonable.
Indeed, if a man had occasion for a high Roman nose,
he must go to the price of it. A carbuncle nose likewise
bore an excessive rate: but for your ordinary
short turned-up noses, of which there was the greatest
consumption, they cost little or nothing; at least the
purchasers thought so, who would have been content
to have paid much dearer for them, rather than to have
gone without them.</p>

<p>The sympathy betwixt the nose and its parent was
very extraordinary. "Hudibras" has told us, that
when the porter died, the nose dropped of course, in
which case it was always usual to return the nose, in
order to have it interred with its first owner. The nose
was likewise affected by the pain as well as death of the
original proprietor. An eminent instance of this nature
happened to three Spaniards whose noses were all made
out of the same piece of brawn. They found them
one day shoot and swell extremely, upon which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
sent to know how the porter did, and heard upon inquiry,
that the parent of the noses had been severely
kicked the day before, and that the porter kept his bed
on account of the bruises it had received. This was
highly resented by the Spaniards, who found out the
person that had used the porter so unmercifully, and
treated him in the same manner as if the indignity had
been done to their own noses. In this and several other
cases it might be said, that the porters led the gentlemen
by the nose.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if anything went amiss with the
nose, the porter felt the effects of it, insomuch that it
was generally articled with the patient, that he should
not only abstain from all his old courses, but should on
no pretence whatever smell pepper, or eat mustard; on
which occasion, the part where the incision had been made
was seized with unspeakable twinges and prickings.</p>

<p>The Englishman I before mentioned was so very irregular,
and relapsed so frequently into the distemper
which at first brought him to the learned Talicotius,
that in the space of two years he wore out five noses,
and by that means so tormented the porters, that if he
would have given &pound;500 for a nose, there was not one
of them that would accommodate him. This young
gentleman was born of honest parents, and passed his
first years in fox-hunting; but accidentally quitting the
woods, and coming up to London, he was so charmed
with the beauties of the play-house, that he had not
been in town two days before he got the misfortune
which carried off this part of his face. He used to
be called in Germany, the Englishman of five noses,
and, the gentleman that had thrice as many noses as
he had ears: such was the raillery of those times.</p>

<p>I shall close this paper with an admonition to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
young men of this town, which I think the more necessary,
because I see several new fresh-coloured faces, that
have made their first appearance in it this winter. I
must therefore assure them, that the art of making
noses is entirely lost; and in the next place, beg them
not to follow the example of our ordinary town rakes,
who live as if there was a Talicotius to be met with
at the corner of every street. Whatever young men
may think, the nose is a very becoming part of the face,
and a man makes but a very silly figure without it.
But it is the nature of youth not to know the value of
anything till they have lost it. The general precept,
therefore, I shall leave with them is, to regard every
town-woman as a particular kind of siren, that has a
design upon their noses; and that, amidst her flatteries
and allurements, they will fancy she speaks to them in
that humorous phrase of old Plautus:</p>

<p class="center">"Keep your face out of my way, or I'll bite off your nose."

for his elegance as a Latin Writer, was born in Verona in
1483, and died in that neighborhood, of an apoplexy, in 1553, at
the age of seventy-one. He was a man of blameless life and engaging
manners, which so endeared him to his friends and countrymen,
that they erected a statue to his memory six years after his
death. His "Syphilis," the book here alluded to, was printed with
his other works in two volumes, at Padua, in 1735. There is a
separate edition of his poetical works, printed at the same place in

From <em>Thursday, Dec. 7</em>, to <em>Saturday, Dec. 9, 1710</em>.</h2>


<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Dec. 8.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is the duty of all who make philosophy the entertainment
of their lives, to turn their thoughts to
practical schemes for the good of society, and not pass
away their time in fruitless searches, which tend rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
to the ostentation of knowledge than the service of life.
For this reason I cannot forbear reading even the
common bills that are daily put into people's hands
as they pass the streets, which give us notice of the
present residence, the past travels, and infallible medicines
of doctors, useful in their generation, though
much below the character of the renowned Talicotius:
but upon a nice calculation of the successes of such adepts,
I find their labours tend mostly to the enriching only
one sort of men, that is to say, the Society of Upholders.
From this observation, and many other which occur to
me when I am numbering the good people of Great
Britain, I cannot but favour any proposal which tends
to repairing the losses we sustain by eminent cures.
The best I have met with in this kind, has been offered
to my consideration, and recommended by a letter, subscribed
Thomas Clement.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The title to his printed
articles runs thus: "By the Profitable Society at the
Wheat Sheaf, over against Tom's Coffee-house, in Russell
Street, Covent Garden, new proposals for promoting a
contribution towards raising two hundred and fifty
pounds to be made on the baptizing of any infant born
in wedlock." The plan is laid with such proper regulations,
as serves (to such as fall in with it for the
sake of their posterity) all the uses, without any of the
inconveniences of settlements. By this means, such
whose fortunes depend upon their own industry, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>personal qualifications, need not be deterred by fear of
poverty from that state which nature and reason prescribe
to us as the fountain of the greatest happiness
in human life. The censors of Rome had power vested
in them to lay taxes on the unmarried; and I think I
cannot show my impartiality better than in inquiring
into the extravagant privileges my brother bachelors
enjoy, and fine them accordingly. I shall not allow
a single life in one sex to be reproached, and held in
esteem in the other. It would not, methinks, be amiss,
if an old bachelor, who lives in contempt of matrimony,
were obliged to give a portion to an old maid who is
willing to enter into it. At the same time I must allow,
that those who can plead courtship, and were unjustly
rejected, shall not be liable to the pains and penalties
of celibacy. But such as pretend an aversion to the
whole sex, because they were ill-treated by a particular
female, and cover their sense of disappointment in
women under a contempt of their favour, shall be
proceeded against as bachelors convict. I am not
without hopes, that from this slight warning, all the
unmarried men of fortune, taste, and refinement, will,
without further delay, become lovers and humble
servants to such of their acquaintance as are most
agreeable to them, under pain of my censures: and it
is to be hoped, the rest of the world, who remain
single for fear of the encumbrances of wedlock, will
become subscribers to Mr. Clement's proposal. By
these means we shall have a much more numerous account
of births in the year 1711, than any ever before
known in Great Britain, where merely to be born is a
distinction of Providence, greater than being born to a
fortune in another place.</p>

<p>As I was going on in the consideration of this good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
office which Mr. Clement proposes to do his country, I
received the following letter, which seems to be dictated
by a like modest and public spirit, that makes use of
me also in its design of obliging mankind:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"In the royal lottery for a million and a half, I had
the good fortune of obtaining a prize. From
before the drawing I had devoted a fifth of whatever
should arise to me to charitable uses. Accordingly I
lately troubled you with my request and commission for
placing half-a-dozen youths with Mr. More,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> writing-master
in Castle Street, to whom, it is said, we owe all
the fine devices, flourishes, and the composure of all
the plates, for the drawing and paying the tickets. Be
pleased therefore, good sir, to find or make leisure for
complying therewith, for I would not appear concerned
in this small matter. I am very much</p>

<p class="right">"Your humble Servant, &amp;c."</p>

<p>It is no small pleasure to observe, that in the midst of
a very degenerate age, there are still spirits which retain
their natural dignity, and pursue the good of their
fellow-creatures: some in making themselves useful by
professed service, some by secret generosity. Were I at
liberty to discover even all the good I know of many
men living at this time, there would want nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
a suitable historian to make them appear as illustrious
as any of the noblest of the old Greeks or Romans.
The cunning some have used to do handsome and
worthy actions, the address to do men services, and
escape their notice, has produced so many surprising
incidents (which have been laid before me during my
censorship), as, in the opinion of posterity, would
absolve this age of all its crimes and follies. I know
no way to deal with such delicate minds as these, but
by assuring them, that when they cease to do good, I
shall tell all the good they have done already. Let
therefore the benefactor to the youths above-mentioned
continue such bounties, upon pain of being publicly
praised. But there is no probability of his running
into that hazard; for a strong habit of virtue can make
men suspend the receiving acknowledgments due to their
merit, till they are out of a capacity of receiving them.
I am so very much charmed with accidents of this kind,
that I have made a collection of all the memorable
handsome things done by private men in my time. As
a specimen of my manner of noting such actions, take
the following fragment out of much more which is
written in my Year-Book, on the remarkable will of a
gentleman, whom I shall here call Celamico.</p>

<p>"This day died that plain and excellent man, my
much honoured friend Celamico, who bequeathed his
whole estate to a gentleman no way related to him,
and to whom he had given no such expectation in his
lifetime."</p>

<p>He was a person of a very enlarged soul, and thought
the nearest relation among men to be the resemblance of
their minds and sentiments. He was not mistaken in
the worth of his successor, who received the news of
this unexpected good fortune with an air that showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
him less moved with the benefit than the loss of the
benefactor.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Timothy Treatall, Gent., was indicted by several
ladies of his sisters' acquaintance for a very rude
affront offered to them at an entertainment, to which
he had invited them on Tuesday the 7th of November
last past, between the hours of eight and nine in the
evening. The indictment set forth, that the said Mr.
Treatall, upon the serving up of the supper, desired the
ladies to take their places according to their different
age and seniority, for that it was the way always at his
table to pay respect to years. The indictment added,
that this produced an unspeakable confusion in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
company; for that the ladies, who before had pressed
together for a place at the upper end of the table,
immediately crowded with the same disorder towards
the end that was quite opposite; that Mrs. Frontly had
the insolence to clap herself down at the very lowest
place of the table; that the Widow Partlett seated herself
on the right hand of Mrs. Frontly, alleging for her
excuse, that no ceremony was to be used at a round
table; that Mrs. Fidget and Mrs. Fescue disputed above
half-an-hour for the same chair, and that the latter
would not give up the cause till it was decided by the
parish register, which happened to be kept hard by.
The indictment further said, that the rest of the company
who sat down, did it with a reserve to their right,
which they were at liberty to assert on another occasion;
and that Mrs. Mary Pippe, an old maid, was placed by
the unanimous vote of the whole company at the upper
end of the table, from whence she had the confusion to
behold several mothers of families among her inferiors.
The criminal alleged in his defence, that what he had
done, was to raise mirth, and avoid ceremony, and that
the ladies did not complain of his rudeness till the next
morning, having eaten up what he had provided for
them with great readiness and alacrity. The Censor
frowning upon him told him, that he ought not to
discover so much levity in matters of a serious nature,
and (upon the jury's bringing him in guilty) sentenced
him to treat the whole assembly of ladies over again,
and to take care he did it with the decorum which was
due to persons of their quality.</p>

<p>Rebecca Shapely, spinster, was indicted by Mrs. Sarah
Smack, for speaking many words reflecting upon her
reputation, and the heels of her silk slippers, which the
prisoner had maliciously suggested to be two inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
higher than they really were. The prosecutor urged,
as an aggravation of her guilt, that the prisoner was
herself guilty of the same kind of forgery which she had
laid to the prosecutor's charge, for that she, the said
Rebecca Shapely, did always wear a pair of steel bodice,
and a false rump. The Censor ordered the slippers to
be produced in open court, where the heels were adjudged
to be of the statutable size. He then ordered the grand
jury to search the criminal, who, after some time spent
therein, acquitted her of the bodice, but found her guilty
of the rump; upon which she received sentence as is usual
in such cases.</p>

<p>William Trippitt, Esq., of the Middle Temple,
brought his action against the Lady Elizabeth Prudely,
for having refused him her hand as he offered to lead
her to her coach from the opera. The plaintiff set forth,
that he had entered himself into the list of those volunteers
who officiate every night behind the boxes as gentlemen-ushers
of the play-house; that he had been at a
considerable charge in white gloves, periwigs, and snuff-boxes,
in order to qualify himself for that employment,
and in hopes of making his fortune by it. The counsel
for the defendant replied, that the plaintiff had given
out that he was within a month of wedding their client,
and that she had refused her hand to him in ceremony,
lest he should interpret it as a promise that she would
give it him in marriage. As soon as their pleadings on
both sides were finished, the Censor ordered the plaintiff
to be cashiered from his office of gentleman-usher to the
play-house, since it was too plain that he had undertaken
it with an ill design; and at the same time ordered the
defendant either to marry the said plaintiff, or to pay
him half-a-crown for the new pair of gloves and coach-hire
that he was at the expense of in her service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lady Townly brought an action of debt against
Mrs. Flambeau, for that the said Mrs. Flambeau had
not been to see the said Lady Townly, and wish her joy,
since her marriage with Sir Ralph, notwithstanding she,
the said Lady Townly, had paid Mrs. Flambeau a visit
upon her first coming to town. It was urged in the
behalf of the defendant, that the plaintiff had never
given her any regular notice of her being in town; that
the visit she alleged had been made on a Monday, which
she knew was a day on which Mrs. Flambeau was always
abroad, having set aside that only day in the week to
mind the affairs of her family; that the servant who
inquired whether she was at home did not give the visiting
knock; that it was not between the hours of five
and eight in the evening; that there was no candles
lighted up; that it was not on Mrs. Flambeau's day;
and, in short, that there was not one of the essential
points observed that constitute a visit. She further
proved by her porter's book, which was produced in
court, that she had paid the Lady Townly a visit on the
twenty-fourth day of March,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> just before her leaving the
town, in the year 1709-10, for which she was still
creditor to the said Lady Townly. To this the plaintiff
only replied, that she was now under covert, and not
liable to any debts contracted when she was a single
woman. Mr. Bickerstaff finding the cause to be very
intricate, and that several points of honour were likely
to arise in it, he deferred giving judgment upon it till
the next session day, at which time he ordered the ladies
on his left hand to present to the court a table of all the
laws relating to visits.</p>

<p>Winifred Lear brought her action against Richard Sly
for having broken a marriage contract, and wedded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
another woman, after he had engaged himself to marry
the said Winifred Lear. She alleged, that he had ogled
her twice at an opera, thrice in St. James's Church, and
once at Powell's Puppet-Show,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> at which time he promised
her marriage by a side glance, as her friend could testify
that sat by her. Mr. Bickerstaff finding that the defendant
had made no further overture of love or marriage,
but by looks and ocular engagement; yet at the same
time considering how very apt such impudent seducers
are to lead the ladies' hearts astray, ordered the criminal
to stand upon the stage in the Haymarket, between each
act of the next opera, there to be exposed to public view
as a false ogler.</p>

<p>Upon the rising of the court, Mr. Bickerstaff having
taken one of these counterfeits in the very fact as he was
ogling a lady of the grand jury, ordered him to be seized,
and prosecuted upon the statute of ogling. He likewise
directed the clerk of the court to draw up an edict against
these common cheats, that make women believe they are
distracted for them by staring them out of countenance,
and often blast a lady's reputation whom they never
spoke to, by saucy looks and distant familiarities.</p>

Powell (sometimes called Robert) was a cripple who came to London
from Bath in 1710, and set up "Punch's Theatre" under the Piazza
in Covent Garden. There he produced puppet plays, burlesquing
the operas at the Haymarket. Defoe, or whoever was the author of
the "Groans of Great Britain" (1711), lamented Powell's popularity,
and said that he was rich enough to buy up all the poets of England.
In 1715 Thomas Burnet wrote a satire on Robert Harley under the
title of a "History of Robert Powell the Puppet-Showman."</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment Dec. 13.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">An old friend of mine being lately come to town, I
went to see him on Tuesday last about eight o'clock
in the evening, with a design to sit with him an hour or
two and talk over old stories; but upon inquiring after
him, his servant told me he was just gone to bed. The
next morning, as soon as I was up and dressed, and had
despatched a little business, I came again to my friend's
house about eleven o'clock, with a design to renew my
visit; but upon asking for him, his servant told me he
was just sat down to dinner. In short, I found that my
old-fashioned friend religiously adhered to the example
of his forefathers, and observed the same hours that had
been kept in the family ever since the Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very plain that the night was much longer formerly
in this island than it is at present. By the night
I mean that portion of time which nature has thrown
into darkness, and which the wisdom of mankind had
formerly dedicated to rest and silence. This used to
begin at eight o'clock in the evening, and conclude at six
in the morning. The curfew, or eight o'clock bell, was
the signal throughout the nation for putting out their
candles and going to bed.</p>

<p>Our grandmothers, though they were wont to sit up
the last in the family, were all of them fast asleep at the
same hours that their daughters are busy at crimp and
basset.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Modern statesmen are concerting schemes, and
engaged in the depth of politics, at the time when their
forefathers were laid down quietly to rest, and had
nothing in their heads but dreams. As we have thus
thrown business and pleasure into the hours of rest, and
by that means made the natural night but half as long as
it should be, we are forced to piece it out with a great
part of the morning; so that near two-thirds of the
nation lie fast asleep for several hours in broad daylight.
This irregularity is grown so very fashionable at present,
that there is scarce a lady of quality in Great Britain
that ever saw the sun rise. And if the humour increases
in proportion to what it has done of late years, it is not
impossible but our children may hear the bellman going
about the streets at nine o'clock in the morning, and the
watch making their rounds till eleven. This unaccountable
disposition in mankind to continue awake in the
night, and sleep in sunshine, has made me inquire,
whether the same change of inclination has happened to
any other animals? For this reason I desired a friend of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>mine in the country to let me know, whether the lark
rises as early as he did formerly? and whether the
cock begins to crow at his usual hour? My friend has
answered me, that his poultry are as regular as ever, and
that all the birds and the beasts of his neighbourhood
keep the same hours that they have observed in the
memory of man; and the same which, in all probability,
they have kept for these five thousand years.</p>

<p>If you would see the innovations that have been made
among us in this particular, you may only look into the
hours of colleges, where they still dine at eleven, and
sup at six, which were doubtless the hours of the whole
nation at the time when those places were founded.
But at present the courts of justice are scarce opened
in Westminster Hall at the time when William Rufus
used to go to dinner in it. All business is driven forward:
the landmarks of our fathers (if I may so call
them) are removed, and planted further up into the day;
insomuch that I am afraid our clergy will be obliged (if
they expect full congregations) not to look any more
upon ten o'clock in the morning as a canonical hour.
In my own memory the dinner has crept by degrees from
twelve o'clock to three, and where it will fix nobody
knows.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>I have sometimes thought to draw up a memorial in
the behalf of supper against dinner, setting forth, that
the said dinner has made several encroachments upon
the said supper, and entered very far upon his frontiers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
that he has banished him out of several families, and in
all has driven him from his headquarters, and forced
him to make his retreat into the hours of midnight;
and in short, that he is now in danger of being entirely
confounded and lost in a breakfast. Those who have
read Lucian, and seen the complaints of the letter "t"
against "s" upon account of many injuries and usurpations
of the same nature,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> will not, I believe, think such
a memorial forced and unnatural. If dinner has been
thus postponed, or (if you please) kept back from time
to time, you may be sure that it has been in compliance
with the other business of the day, and that supper has
still observed a proportionable distance. There is a
venerable proverb, which we have all of us heard in our
infancy, of "putting the children to bed, and laying the
goose to the fire." This was one of the jocular sayings
of our forefathers, but may be properly used in the
literal sense at present. Who would not wonder at this
perverted relish of those who are reckoned the most
polite part of mankind, that prefer sea-coals<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and candles
to the sun, and exchange so many cheerful morning hours
for the pleasures of midnight revels and debauches? If
a man was only to consult his health, he would choose
to live his whole time (if possible) in daylight, and to
retire out of the world into silence and sleep, while the
raw damps and unwholesome vapours fly abroad without
a sun to disperse, moderate, or control them. For my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>own part, I value an hour in the morning as much as
common libertines do an hour at midnight. When I
find myself awakened into being, and perceive my life
renewed within me, and at the same time see the whole
face of nature recovered out of the dark uncomfortable
state in which it lay for several hours, my heart overflows
with such secret sentiments of joy and gratitude as are a
kind of implicit<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> praise to the great Author of Nature.
The mind in these early seasons of the day is so refreshed
in all its faculties, and borne up with such new supplies
of animal spirits, that she finds herself in a state of youth,
especially when she is entertained with the breath of
flowers, the melody of birds, the dews that hang upon
the plants, and all those other sweets of nature that are
peculiar to the morning.</p>

<p>It is impossible for a man to have this relish of being,
this exquisite taste of life, who does not come into the
world before it is in all its noise and hurry; who loses
the rising of the sun, the still hours of the day, and
immediately upon his first getting up plunges himself
into the ordinary cares or follies of the world.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this paper with Milton's inimitable
description of Adam's awakening his Eve in Paradise,
which indeed would have been a place as little delightful
as a barren heath or desert to those who slept in it.
The fondness of the posture in which Adam is represented,
and the softness of his whisper, are passages in
this divine poem that are above all commendation, and
rather to be admired than praised.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Dec. 15.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Boccalini<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> in his "Parnassus," indicts a laconic writer
for speaking that in three words which he might
have said in two, and sentences him for his punishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>to read over all the works of Guicciardin.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> This Guicciardin
is so very prolix and circumstantial in his writings,
that I remember our countryman Dr. Donne, speaking
of that majestic and concise manner in which Moses has
described the creation of the world, adds that "if such
an author as Guicciardin were to have written on such a
subject, the world itself would not have been able to have
contained the books that gave the history of its creation."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>I look upon a tedious talker, or what is generally
known by the name of a story-teller, to be much more
insufferable than even a prolix writer. An author may
be tossed out of your hand and thrown aside when he
grows dull and tiresome; but such liberties are so far
from being allowed towards your orators in common
conversation, that I have known a challenge sent a
person for going out of the room abruptly, and leaving
a man of honour in the midst of a dissertation. This
evil is at present so very common and epidemical, that
there is scarce a coffee-house in town that has not some
speakers belonging to it, who utter their political essays,
and draw parallels out of Baker's "Chronicle"<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> to almost
every part of her Majesty's reign. It was said of two
ancient authors who had very different beauties in their
style, that if you took a word from one of them, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>only spoiled his eloquence; but if you took a word
from the other, you spoiled his sense. I have often
applied the first part of this criticism to several of these
coffee-house speakers whom I have at present in my
thoughts, though the character that is given to the last
of those authors is what I would recommend to the
imitation of my loving countrymen: but it is not only
public places of resort, but private clubs and conversations
over a bottle, that are infested with this loquacious
kind of animal, especially with that species which I
comprehend under the name of a story-teller. I would
earnestly desire these gentlemen to consider, that no
point of wit or mirth at the end of a story can atone
for the half-hour that has been lost before they come at
it. I would likewise lay it home to their serious consideration,
whether they think that every man in the
company has not a right to speak as well as themselves?
and whether they do not think they are invading another
man's property, when they engross the time which should
be divided equally amongst the company to their own
private use?</p>

<p>What makes this evil the much greater in conversation
is, that these humdrum companions seldom endeavour
to wind up their narrations into a point of mirth or
instruction, which might make some amends for the
tediousness of them, but think they have a right to tell
anything that has happened within their memory. They
look upon matter of fact to be a sufficient foundation
for a story, and give us a long account of things, not
because they are entertaining or surprising, but because
they are true.</p>

<p>My ingenious kinsman, Mr. Humphry Wagstaff,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> used
to say, the life of man is too short for a story-teller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>Methusalem might be half an hour in telling what
o'clock it was; but as for us postdiluvians, we ought to
do everything in haste; and in our speeches, as well as
actions, remember that our time is short. A man that
talks for a quarter of an hour together in company, if I
meet him frequently, takes up a great part of my span.
A quarter of an hour may be reckoned the eight and
fortieth part of a day, a day the three hundred and
sixtieth part of a year, and a year the threescore and
tenth part of life. By this moral arithmetic, supposing
a man to be in the talking world one-third part of the
day, whoever gives another a quarter of an hour's hearing,
makes him a sacrifice of more than the four hundred
thousandth part of his conversable life.</p>

<p>I would establish but one great general rule to be
observed in all conversation, which is this, that men
should not talk to please themselves, but those that hear
them. This would make them consider, whether what
they speak be worth hearing; whether there be either
wit or sense in what they are about to say; and
whether it be adapted to the time when, the place where,
and the person to whom, it is spoken.</p>

<p>For the utter extirpation of these orators and story-tellers,
which I look upon as very great pests of society,
I have invented a watch, which divides the minute into
twelve parts, after the same manner that the ordinary
watches are divided into hours; and will endeavour to
get a patent, which shall oblige every club or company
to provide themselves with one of these watches (that shall
lie upon the table as an hour-glass is often placed near
the pulpit) to measure out the length of a discourse.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>I shall be willing to allow a man one round of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
watch, that is, a whole minute, to speak in; but if he
exceeds that time, it shall be lawful for any of the
company to look upon the watch, or to call him down
to order.</p>

<p>Provided, however, that if any one can make it appear
he is turned of threescore, he may take two, or, if he
pleases, three rounds of the watch without giving offence.
Provided also, that this rule be not construed to extend
to the fair sex, who shall still be at liberty to talk by
the ordinary watch that is now in use. I would likewise
earnestly recommend this little automaton, which may
be easily carried in the pocket without any encumbrance,
to all such as are troubled with this infirmity of speech,
that upon pulling out their watches, they may have
frequent occasion to consider what they are doing, and
by that means cut the thread of their story short, and
hurry to a conclusion. I shall only add, that this watch,
with a paper of directions how to use it, is sold at
Charles Lillie's.</p>

<p>I am afraid a <cite>Tatler</cite> will be thought a very improper
paper to censure this humour of being talkative; but I
would have my readers know, that there is a great
difference between tattle and loquacity, as I shall show
at large in a following Lucubration,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> it being my design
to throw away a candle upon that subject, in order to
explain the whole art of tattling in all its branches and
subdivisions.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Continuation of the Journal of the</span>
<span class="smcap">Court of Honour, &amp;c.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">As soon as the court was sat, the ladies of the bench
presented, according to order, a table of all the
laws now in force relating to visits and visiting-days,
methodically digested under their respective heads, which
the Censor ordered to be laid upon the table, and afterwards
proceeded upon the business of the day.</p>

<p>Henry Heedless, Esq., was indicted by Colonel Touchy,
of her Majesty's trained-bands,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> upon an action of
assault and battery; for that he the said Mr. Heedless
having espied a feather upon the shoulder of the said
colonel, struck it off gently with the end of a walking-staff,
value threepence. It appeared, that the prosecutor
did not think himself injured till a few days after the
aforesaid blow was given him; but that having ruminated
with himself for several days, and conferred upon it with
other officers of the militia, he concluded, that he had in
effect been cudgelled by Mr. Heedless, and that he ought
to resent it accordingly. The counsel for the prosecutor
alleged, that the shoulder was the tenderest part in a
man of honour; that it had a natural antipathy to a
stick, and that every touch of it, with anything made in
the fashion of a cane, was to be interpreted as a wound
in that part, and a violation of the person's honour who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>received it. Mr. Heedless replied, that what he had
done was out of kindness to the prosecutor, as not
thinking it proper for him to appear at the head of the
trained-bands with a feather upon his shoulder; and
further added, that the stick he had made use of on this
occasion was so very small, that the prosecutor could
not have felt it, had he broken it on his shoulders.
The Censor hereupon directed the jury to examine into
the nature of the staff, for that a great deal would
depend upon that particular. Upon which he explained
to them the different degrees of offence that might be
given by the touch of crab-tree from that of cane, and
by the touch of cane from that of a plain hazel stick.
The jury, after a short perusal of the staff, declared
their opinion by the mouth of their foreman, that the
substance of the staff was British oak. The Censor then
observing that there was some dust on the skirts of the
criminal's coat, ordered the prosecutor to beat it off with
his aforesaid oaken plant; "and thus," said the Censor, "I
shall decide this cause by the law of retaliation: if Mr.
Heedless did the colonel a good office, the colonel will
by this means return it in kind; but if Mr. Heedless
should at any time boast that he had cudgelled the
colonel, or laid his staff over his shoulders, the colonel
might boast in his turn, that he has brushed Mr. Heedless's
jacket, or (to use the phrase of an ingenious author)
that he has rubbed him down with an oaken towel."</p>

<p>Benjamin Busy, of London, merchant, was indicted by
Jasper Tattle, Esq., for having pulled out his watch and
looked upon it thrice, while the said Esquire Tattle was
giving him an account of the funeral of the said Esquire
Tattle's first wife. The prisoner alleged in his defence,
that he was going to buy stocks at the time when he
met the prosecutor; and that, during the story of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
prosecutor, the said stocks rose above two per cent.,
to the great detriment of the prisoner. The prisoner
further brought several witnesses, that the said Jasper
Tattle, Esq., was a most notorious story-teller; that
before he met the prisoner, he had hindered one of the
prisoner's acquaintance from the pursuit of his lawful
business, with the account of his second marriage; and
that he had detained another by the button of his coat
that very morning, till he had heard several witty sayings
and contrivances of the prosecutor's eldest son, who was a
boy of about five years of age. Upon the whole matter,
Mr. Bickerstaff dismissed the accusation as frivolous, and
sentenced the prosecutor to pay damages to the prisoner
for what the prisoner had lost by giving him so long
and patient a hearing. He further reprimanded the
prosecutor very severely, and told him, that if he proceeded
in his usual manner to interrupt the business of
mankind, he would set a fine upon him for every quarter
of an hour's impertinence, and regulate the said fine
according as the time of the person so injured should
appear to be more or less precious.</p>

<p>Sir Paul Swash, Kt., was indicted by Peter Double,
Gent., for not returning the bow which he received of
the said Peter Double, on Wednesday the 6th instant, at
the play-house in the Haymarket. The prisoner denied
the receipt of any such bow, and alleged in his defence,
that the prosecutor would oftentimes look full in his
face, but that when he bowed to the said prosecutor, he
would take no notice of it, or bow to somebody else that
sat quite on the other side of him. He likewise alleged,
that several ladies had complained of the prosecutor,
who, after ogling them a quarter of an hour, upon their
making a curtsey to him, would not return the civility
of a bow. The Censor observing several glances of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
prosecutor's eye, and perceiving, that when he talked to
the court, he looked upon the jury, found reason to
suspect that there was a wrong cast in his sight, which
upon examination proved true. The Censor therefore
ordered the prisoner (that he might not produce any
more confusions in public assemblies) never to bow to
anybody whom he did not at the same time call to by
his name.</p>

<p>Oliver Bluff, and Benjamin Browbeat, were indicted
for going to fight a duel since the erection of the Court
of Honour. It appeared, that they were both taken up
in the street as they passed by the court, in their way
to the fields behind Montague House.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The criminals
would answer nothing for themselves, but that they
were going to execute a challenge which had been made
above a week before the Court of Honour was erected.
The Censor finding some reasons to suspect (by the
sturdiness of their behaviour) that they were not so
very brave as they would have the court believe them,
ordered them both to be searched by the grand jury,
who found a breast-plate upon the one, and two quires
of paper upon the other. The breast-plate was immediately
ordered to be hung upon a peg over Mr.
Bickerstaff's tribunal, and the paper to be laid upon the
table for the use of his clerk. He then ordered the
criminals to button up their bosoms, and, if they pleased,
proceed to their duel. Upon which they both went very
quietly out of the court, and retired to their respective
lodgings.</p>

<p>The court then adjourned till after the holidays.</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Dec. 20.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It would be a good appendix to the "Art of Living
and Dying,"<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> if any one would write the art of
growing old, and teach men to resign their pretensions
to the pleasures and gallantries of youth, in proportion
to the alteration they find in themselves by the approach
of age and infirmities. The infirmities of this stage of
life would be much fewer, if we did not affect those
which attend the more vigorous and active part of our
days; but instead of studying to be wiser, or being
contented with our present follies, the ambition of many
of us is also to be the same sort of fools we formerly
have been. I have often argued, as I am a professed
lover of women, that our sex grows old with a much
worse grace than the other does; and have ever been of
opinion, that there are more well-pleased old women
than old men. I thought it a good reason for this, that
the ambition of the fair sex being confined to advantageous
marriages, or shining in the eyes of men, their
parts were over sooner, and consequently the errors in
the performance of them. The conversation of this
evening has not convinced me of the contrary; for one
or two fop women shall not make a balance for the
crowds of coxcombs among ourselves, diversified according
to the different pursuits of pleasure and business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>Returning home this evening a little before my usual
hour, I scarce had seated myself in my easy-chair, stirred
the fire and stroked my cat, but I heard somebody come
rumbling upstairs. I saw my door opened, and a human
figure advancing towards me, so fantastically put together,
'twas some minutes before I discovered it to be my old
and intimate friend Sam Trusty.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Immediately I rose
up, and placed him in my own seat, a compliment I pay to
few. The first thing he uttered was, "Isaac, fetch me a
cup of your cherry brandy before you offer to ask me
any question." He drank a lusty draught, sat silent for
some time, and at last broke out: "I am come," quoth
he, "to insult thee for an old fantastic dotard as thou art
in ever defending the women. I have this evening visited
two widows, who are now in that state I have often heard
you call an after-life:<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> I suppose you mean by it an
existence which grows out of past entertainments, and is
an untimely delight in the satisfactions which they once
set their hearts upon too much to be ever able to relinquish.
Have but patience," continued he, "till I give you
a succinct account of my ladies, and of this night's
adventure. They are much of an age, but very different
in their characters: the one of them, with all the advances
which years have made upon her, goes on in a
certain romantic road of love and friendship which she
fell into in her teens; the other has transferred the
amorous passions of her first years to the love of cronies,
pets and favourites, with which she is always surrounded;
but the genius of each of them will best appear by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>account of what happened to me at their houses. About
five this afternoon, being tired with study, the weather
inviting, and time lying a little upon my hands, I resolved,
at the instigation of my evil genius, to visit them, their
husbands having been our contemporaries. This I
thought I could do without much trouble, for both live
in the very next street. I went first to my Lady Camomile,
and the butler, who had lived long in the family,
and seen me often in his master's time, ushered me very
civilly into the parlour, and told me, though my lady
had given strict orders to be denied, he was sure I might
be admitted, and bid the black boy<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> acquaint his lady,
that I was to wait upon her. In the window lay two
letters, one broke open, the other fresh sealed with a
wafer: the first directed to the divine Cosmelia, the
second to the charming Lucinda; but both, by the
indented characters, appeared to have been writ by very
unsteady hands. Such uncommon addresses increased
my curiosity, and put me upon asking my old friend the
butler, if he knew who those persons were? 'Very
well,' says he: 'this is from Mrs. Furbish to my lady,
an old schoolfellow and great crony of her ladyship's,
and this the answer.' I inquired in what country she
lived. 'Oh dear!' says he, 'but just by in the neighbourhood.
Why, she was here all this morning, and that letter
came and was answered within these two hours. They
have taken an odd fancy, you must know, to call one
another hard names, but for all that they love one
another hugely.' By this time the boy returned with his
lady's humble service to me, desiring I would excuse her,
for she could not possibly see me, nor anybody else, for
it was opera night.</p>

<p>"Methinks," says I, "such innocent folly as two old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
women's courtship to each other should rather make you
merry, than put you out of humour." "Peace, good
Isaac," says he, "no interruption I beseech you. I got
soon to Mrs. Feeble's, she that was formerly Betty Frisk;
you must needs remember her, Tom Feeble of Brasenose
fell in love with her for her fine dancing. Well,
Mrs. Ursula, without further ceremony, carries me
directly up to her mistress's chamber, where I found her
environed by four of the most mischievous animals that
can ever infest a family: an old shock<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> dog with one
eye, a monkey chained to one side of the chimney, a great
grey squirrel to the other, and a parrot waddling in the
middle of the room. However, for a while, all was in a
profound tranquillity. Upon the mantel-tree, for I am
a pretty curious observer, stood a pot of lambative electuary,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
with a stick of liquorice, and near it a phial of rosewater
and powder of tutty.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Upon the table lay a
pipe filled with betony<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and coltsfoot a roll of wax-candle,
a silver spitting-pot, and a Seville orange. The
lady was placed in a large wicker-chair, and her feet
wrapped up in flannel, supported by cushions; and in
this attitude (would you believe it, Isaac) was she reading
a romance with spectacles on. The first compliments
over, as she was industriously endeavouring to enter
upon conversation, a violent fit of coughing seized her.
This awakened Shock, and in a trice the whole room
was in an uproar; for the dog barked, the squirrel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>squealed, the monkey chattered, the parrot screamed,
and Ursula, to appease them, was more clamorous than
all the rest. You, Isaac, who know how any harsh noise
affects my head, may guess what I suffered from the
hideous din of these discordant sounds. At length all
was appeased, and quiet restored: a chair was drawn for
me, where I was no sooner seated, but the parrot fixed
his horny beak, as sharp as a pair of shears, in one of
my heels, just above the shoe. I sprang from the place
with an unusual agility, and so being within the monkey's
reach, he snatches off my new bob wig, and throws it
upon two apples that were roasting by a sullen sea-coal
fire.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> I was nimble enough to save it from any further
damage than singeing the foretop. I put it on, and
composing myself as well as I could, I drew my chair
towards the other side of the chimney. The good lady,
as soon as she had recovered breath, employed it in
making a thousand apologies, and with great eloquence,
and a numerous train of words, lamented my misfortune.
In the middle of her harangue, I felt something scratching
near my knee, and feeling what it should be, found
the squirrel had got into my coat pocket. As I endeavoured
to remove him from his burrow, he made his
teeth meet through the fleshy part of my forefinger.
This gave me an inexpressible pain. The Hungary
water<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> was immediately brought to bathe it, and gold-beaters'
skin applied to stop the blood. The lady
renewed her excuses; but being now out of all patience,
I abruptly took my leave, and hobbling downstairs with
heedless haste, I set my foot full in a pail of water, and
down we came to the bottom together." Here my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>friend concluded his narrative, and, with a composed
countenance, I began to make him compliments of condolence;
but he started from his chair, and said, "Isaac,
you may spare your speeches, I expect no reply: when I
told you this, I knew you would laugh at me; but the
next woman that makes me ridiculous shall be a young
one."</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment, Dec. 22.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have heard that it is a rule among the conventuals
of several orders in the Romish Church to shut
themselves up at a certain time of the year, not only
from the world in general, but from the members of
their own fraternity, and to pass away several days by
themselves in settling accounts between their Maker and
their own souls, in cancelling unrepented crimes, and
renewing their contracts of obedience for the future.
Such stated times for particular acts of devotion, or the
exercise of certain religious duties, have been enjoined in
all civil governments, whatever deity they worshipped,
or whatever religion they professed. That which may
be done at all times, is often totally neglected and
forgotten, unless fixed and determined to some time
more than another; and therefore, though several duties
may be suitable to every day of our lives, they are most
likely to be performed if some days are more particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
set apart for the practice of them. Our Church has
accordingly instituted several seasons of devotion, when
time, custom, prescription, and (if I may so say) the
fashion itself, call upon a man to be serious and attentive
to the great end of his being.</p>

<p>I have hinted in some former papers, that the greatest
and wisest of men in all ages and countries, particularly
in Rome and Greece, were renowned for their piety and
virtue. It is now my intention to show how those in
our own nation, that have been unquestionably the most
eminent for learning and knowledge, were likewise the
most eminent for their adherence to the religion of their
country.</p>

<p>I might produce very shining examples from among
the clergy; but because priestcraft is the common cry of
every cavilling empty scribbler, I shall show, that all the
laymen who have exerted a more than ordinary genius
in their writings, and were the glory of their times,
were men whose hopes were filled with immortality, and
the prospect of future rewards, and men who lived
in a dutiful submission to all the doctrines of revealed
religion.</p>

<p>I shall in this paper only instance Sir Francis Bacon,
a man who for the greatness of genius, and compass of
knowledge, did honour to his age and country; I could
almost say to human nature itself. He possessed at
once all those extraordinary talents which were divided
amongst the greatest authors of antiquity. He had the
sound, distinct, comprehensive knowledge of Aristotle,
with all the beautiful lights, graces, and embellishments
of Cicero. One does not know which to admire most
in his writings, the strength of reason, force of style, or
brightness of imagination.</p>

<p>This author has remarked in several parts of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
works, that a thorough insight into philosophy makes
a good believer, and that a smattering in it naturally
produces such a race of despicable infidels as the little
profligate writers of the present age, whom (I must
confess) I have always accused to myself, not so much
for their want of faith as their want of learning.</p>

<p>I was infinitely pleased to find among the works of
this extraordinary man a prayer of his own composing,
which, for the elevation of thought, and greatness of
expression, seems rather the devotion of an angel than
a man. His principal fault seems to have been the
excess of that virtue which covers a multitude of faults.
This betrayed him to so great an indulgence towards
his servants, who made a corrupt use of it, that it
stripped him of all those riches and honours which a
long series of merits had heaped upon him. But in this
prayer, at the same time that we find him prostrating
himself before the great mercy-seat, and humbled under
afflictions which at that time lay heavy upon him, we see
him supported by the sense of his integrity, his zeal, his
devotion, and his love to mankind, which give him a
much higher figure in the minds of thinking men, than
that greatness had done from which he was fallen. I shall
beg leave to write down the prayer itself, with the title
to it, as it was found among his lordship's papers, written
in his own hand; not being able to furnish my reader
with an entertainment more suitable to this solemn time.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Prayer or Psalm made by my Lord Bacon,</span>
<span class="smcap">Chancellor of England.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">"Most gracious Lord God, my merciful Father;
from my youth up my Creator, my Redeemer,
my Comforter. Thou, O Lord, soundest and searchest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
the depths and secrets of all hearts; Thou acknowledgest
the upright of heart; Thou judgest the hypocrite; Thou
ponderest men's thoughts and doings as in a balance;
Thou measurest their intentions as with a line; vanity
and crooked ways cannot be hid from Thee.</p>

<p>"Remember, O Lord! how Thy servant hath walked
before Thee; remember what I have first sought, and
what hath been principal in my intentions. I have
loved Thy assemblies, I have mourned for the divisions
of Thy Church, I have delighted in the brightness of
Thy sanctuary. This vine which Thy right hand hath
planted in this nation, I have ever prayed unto Thee,
that it might have the first and the latter rain, and that
it might stretch her branches to the seas, and to the
floods. The state and bread of the poor and oppressed
have been precious in mine eyes; I have hated all cruelty
and hardness of heart; I have (though in a despised
weed) procured the good of all men. If any have been
my enemies, I thought not of them, neither hath the
sun almost set upon my displeasure; but I have been as
a dove, free from superfluity of maliciousness. Thy
creatures have been my books, but Thy Scriptures much
more. I have sought Thee in the courts, fields, and
gardens, but I have found Thee in Thy temples.</p>

<p>"Thousands have been my sins, and ten thousands
my transgressions, but Thy sanctifications have remained
with me, and my heart (through Thy grace) hath been
an unquenched coal upon Thine altar.</p>

<p>"O Lord, my strength! I have since my youth met
with Thee in all my ways, by Thy fatherly compassions,
by Thy comfortable chastisements, and by Thy most
visible providence. As Thy favours have increased
upon me, so have Thy corrections; so as Thou hast
been always near me, O Lord! And ever as my worldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
blessings were exalted, so secret darts from Thee have
pierced me; and when I have ascended before men, I
have descended in humiliation before Thee. And now
when I thought most of peace and honour, Thy hand is
heavy upon me, and hath humbled me according to Thy
former loving-kindness, keeping me still in Thy fatherly
school, not as a bastard, but as a child. Just are Thy
judgments upon me for my sins, which are more in
number than the sands of the sea, but have no proportion
to Thy mercies; for what are the sands of the
sea? Earth, heavens, and all these are nothing to Thy
mercies. Besides my innumerable sins, I confess before
Thee, that I am debtor to Thee for the gracious talent
of Thy gifts and graces, which I have neither put into a
napkin, nor put it (as I ought) to exchangers, where it
might have made best profit, but misspent it in things
for which I was least fit: so I may truly say, my soul
hath been a stranger in the course of my pilgrimage.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for my Saviour's sake, and
receive me unto Thy bosom, or guide me in Thy ways."</p>

<h3><em>From my own Apartment.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">At my coming home last night, I found upon my
table the following petition or project, sent me
from Lloyd's Coffee-house<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> in the city, with a present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>of port wine, which had been bought at a late auction
held in that place:</p>


<h3>"To <span class="smcap">Isaac Bickerstaff</span>, Esq., Censor of
Great Britain.<br />

<em>Lloyd's Coffee-house, Lombard Street, Dec. 23.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">"We the customers of this coffee-house, observing
that you have taken into your consideration the
great mischiefs daily done in this city by coffee-house
orators, do humbly beg leave to represent to you, that
this coffee-house being provided with a pulpit for the
benefit of such auctions that are frequently made in this
place, it is our custom, upon the first coming in of the
news, to order a youth, who officiates as the Kidney<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> of
the coffee-house, to get into the pulpit, and read every
paper with a loud and distinct voice, while the whole
audience are sipping their respective liquors. We do
therefore, sir, humbly propose, that there be a pulpit
erected within every coffee-house of this city and the
adjacent parts; that one of the waiters of the coffee-house
be nominated as reader to the said pulpit; that
after the news of the day has been published by the said
lecturer, some politician of good note do ascend into
the said pulpit; and after having chosen for his text
any article of the said news, that he do establish the
authority of such article, clear the doubts that may arise
thereupon, compare it with parallel texts in other papers,
advance upon it wholesome points of doctrine, and draw
from it salutary conclusions for the benefit and edification
of all that hear him. We do likewise humbly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>propose, that upon any such politician's quitting the
pulpit, he shall be succeeded by any other orator that
finds himself moved by the same public spirit, who shall
be at full liberty either to enforce or overthrow what
the other has said before him, and may in the same
manner be succeeded by any other politician, who shall
with the same liberty confirm or impugn his reasons,
strengthen or invalidate his conjectures, enlarge upon
his schemes, or erect new ones of his own. We do
likewise further propose, that if any person, of what age
or rank soever, do presume to cavil at any paper that
has been read, or to hold forth upon it longer than the
space of one minute, that he be immediately ordered up
into the pulpit, there to make good anything that he
has suggested upon the floor. We do likewise further
propose, that if any one plays the orator in the ordinary
coffee-house conversation, whether it be upon peace or
war, on plays or sermons, business or poetry, that he be
forthwith desired to take his place in the pulpit.</p>

<p>"This, sir, we humbly presume may in a great measure
put a stop to those superficial statesmen who would not
dare to stand up in this manner before a whole congregation
of politicians, notwithstanding the long and tedious
harangues and dissertations which they daily utter in
private circles, to the breaking of many honest tradesmen,
the seducing of several eminent citizens, the making
of numberless malcontents, and to the great detriment
and disquiet of her Majesty's subjects."</p>

<p>I do heartily concur with my ingenious friends of the
above-mentioned coffee-house in these their proposals;
and because I apprehend there may be reasons to put an
immediate stop to the grievance complained of, it is my
intention that, till such time as the aforesaid pulpits can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
be erected, every orator do place himself within the bar,
and from thence dictate whatsoever he shall think necessary
for the public good.</p>

<p>And further, because I am very desirous that proper
ways and means should be found out for the suppressing
of story-tellers and fine talkers<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> in all ordinary conversation
whatsoever, I do insist, that in every private club,
company, or meeting over a bottle, there be always an
elbow-chair placed at the table, and that as soon as any
one begins a long story, or extends his discourse beyond
the space of one minute, he be forthwith thrust into the
said elbow-chair, unless upon any of the company's calling
out to the chair, he breaks off abruptly, and holds
his tongue.</p>

<p>There are two species of men, notwithstanding anything
that has been here said, whom I would exempt
from the disgrace of the elbow-chair. The first are those
buffoons that have a talent of mimicking the speech and
behaviour of other persons, and turning all their patrons,
friends and acquaintance, into ridicule. I look upon
your pantomime as a legion in a man, or at least to
be like Virgil's monster, with a hundred mouths and as
many tongues:</p>

<p class="center">----<i lang="la">Lingu&aelig; centum sunt, oraque centum</i>&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>and therefore would give him as much time to talk in,
as would be allowed to the whole body of persons he
represents, were they actually in the company which they
divert by proxy. Provided however, that the said pantomime
do not, upon any pretence whatsoever, utter anything
in his own particular opinion, language, or character.</p>

<p>I would likewise in the second place grant an exemption
from the elbow-chair to any person who treats the company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
and by that means may be supposed to pay for his
audience. A guest cannot take it ill if he be not allowed
to talk in his turn by a person who puts his mouth to
a better employment, and stops it with good beef and
mutton. In this case the guest is very agreeably silenced,
and seems to hold his tongue under that kind of bribery
which the ancients called <i lang="la">bos in lingua</i>.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>If I can once extirpate the race of solid and substantial
humdrums, I hope, by my wholesome and repeated
advices, quickly to reduce the insignificant tittle-tattles
and matter-of-fact men that abound in every quarter of
this great city.</p>

<p>Epictetus, in his little system of morality, prescribes
the following rule with that beautiful simplicity which
shines through all his precepts: "Beware that thou
never tell thy dreams in company; for notwithstanding
thou mayest take a pleasure in telling thy dreams, the
company will take no pleasure in hearing them."</p>

<p>This rule is conformable to a maxim which I have laid
down in a late paper,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and must always inculcate into
those of my readers who find in themselves an inclination
to be very talkative and impertinent, that they should not
speak to please themselves, but those that hear them.</p>

<p>It has been often observed by witty essay writers, that
the deepest waters are always the most silent; that empty
vessels make the greatest sound, and tinkling cymbals
the worst music. The Marquis of Halifax, in his admirable
"Advice to a Daughter,"<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> tells her, that good
sense has always something sullen in it: but as sullenness
does not only imply silence, but an ill-natured silence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>I wish his lordship had given a softer name to it. Since
I am engaged unawares in quotations, I must not omit
the satire which Horace has written against this impertinent
talkative companion, and which, I think, is fuller
of humour than any other satire he has written. This
great author, who had the nicest taste of conversation,
and was himself a most agreeable companion, had so
strong an antipathy to a great talker, that he was afraid
some time or other it would be mortal to him, as he has
very humorously described it in his conversation with an
impertinent fellow who had liked to have been the death
of him:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I find my correspondents are universally offended at me
for taking notice so seldom of their letters, and fear
people have taken the advantage of my silence to go on
in their errors; for which reason I shall hereafter be
more careful to answer all lawful questions and just
complaints as soon as they come to my hands. The
two following epistles relate to very great mischiefs in
the most important articles of life, love, and friendship:</p>

<p>
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"'Tis my misfortune to be enamoured of a lady that
is neither very beautiful, very witty, nor at all
well-natured; but has the vanity to think she excels in
all these qualifications, and therefore is cruel, insolent,
and scornful. When I study to please her, she treats
me with the utmost rudeness and ill manners: if I
approach her person, she fights, she scratches me: if I
offer a civil salute, she bites me; insomuch, that very
lately, before a whole assembly of ladies and gentlemen,
she ripped out a considerable part of my left cheek.
This is no sooner done, but she begs my pardon in the
most handsome and becoming terms imaginable, gives
herself worse language than I could find in my heart to
do, lets me embrace her to pacify her while she is railing
at herself, protests she deserves the esteem of no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
living, says I am too good to contradict her when she
thus accuses herself. This atones for all, tempts me to
renew my addresses, which are ever returned in the same
obliging manner. Thus, without some speedy relief, I
am in danger of losing my whole face. Notwithstanding
all this, I dote upon her, and am satisfied she loves me,
because she takes me for a man of sense, which I have
been generally thought, except in this one instance.
Your reflections upon this strange amour would be very
useful in these parts, where we are overrun with wild
beauties and romps. I earnestly beg your assistance,
either to deliver me from the power of this unaccountable
enchantment, or, by some proper animadversions,
civilise the behaviour of this agreeable rustic. I am,</p>

censor, and complain to you, that among the
various errors in conversation which you have corrected,
there is one which, though it has not escaped a general
reproof, yet seems to deserve a more particular severity.
'Tis a humour of jesting on disagreeable subjects, and
insisting on the jest the more it creates uneasiness; and
this some men think they have a title to do as friends.
Is the design of jesting to provoke? Or does friendship
give a privilege to say things with a design to shock?
How can that be called a jest which has nothing in it
but bitterness? 'Tis generally allowed necessary, for the
peace of company, that men should a little study the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
tempers of each other; but certainly that must be in
order to shun what's offensive, not to make it a constant
entertainment. The frequent repetition of what appears
harsh, will unavoidably leave a rancour that's fatal to
friendship; and I doubt much, whether it would be an
argument of a man's good humour, if he should be
roused, by perpetual teasing, to treat those that do it as
his enemies. In a word, whereas 'tis a common practice
to let a story die, merely because it does not touch, I
think such as mention one they find does, are as troublesome
to society, and as unfit for it, as wags, men of fire,
good talkers, or any other apes in conversation; and
therefore, for the public benefit, I hope you'll cause
them to be branded with such a name as they deserve.

</p>

<p>The case of Ebenezer is a very common one, and is
always cured by neglect. These fantastical returns of
affection proceed from a certain vanity in the other sex,
supported by a perverted taste in ours. I must publish
it as a rule, that no faults which proceed from the will,
either in a mistress or a friend, are to be tolerated. But
we should be so complaisant to ladies, to let them displease
when they aim at doing it. Pluck up a spirit,
Ebenezer, recover the use of your judgment, and her
faults will appear, or her beauties vanish. "Her faults
begin to please me as well as my own," is a sentence
very prettily put into the mouth of a lover by the comic
poet,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> but he never designed it for a maxim of life, but
the picture of an imperfection. If Ebenezer takes my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>advice, the same temper which made her insolent to his
love, will make her submissive to his indifference.</p>

<p>I cannot wholly ascribe the faults mentioned in the
second letter to the same vanity or pride in companions
who secretly triumph over their friends, in being sharp
upon them in things where they are most tender. But
when this sort of behaviour does not proceed from that
source, it does from barrenness of invention, and an inability
to support a conversation in a way less offensive.
It is the same poverty which makes men speak or write
smuttily, that forces them to talk vexingly. As obscene

<p class="drop-cap">According to my late resolution, I take the holidays
to be no improper season to entertain the town
with the addresses of my correspondents. In my walks
every day there appear all round me very great offenders
in the point of dress. An armed tailor had the impudence
yesterday in the park to smile in my face, and
pull off a laced hat to me, as it were in contempt of
my authority and censure. However, it is a very
great satisfaction, that other people as well as myself
are offended with these improprieties. The following
notices from persons of different sexes and qualities are
a sufficient instance how useful my Lucubrations are to
the public.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"It has been the peculiar blessing of our family to be
always above the smiles or frowns of fortune, and
by a certain greatness of mind to restrain all irregular
fondnesses or passions. From hence it is, that though
a long decay, and a numerous descent, have obliged
many of our house to fall into the arts of trade and
business, no one person of us has ever made an appearance
that betrayed our being unsatisfied with our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
station of life, or has ever affected a mien or gesture
unsuitable to it.</p>

<p>"You have up and down in your writings very justly
remarked, that it is not this or the other profession or
quality among men that gives us honour and esteem, but
the well or ill behaving ourselves in those characters.
It is therefore with no small concern, that I behold in
coffee houses and public places my brethren, the tradesmen
of this city, put off the smooth, even, and ancient
decorum of thriving citizens, for a fantastical dress and
figure, improper for their persons and characters, to the
utter destruction of that order and distinction which of
right ought to be between St. James's and Milk Street,
the Camp and Cheapside.</p>

the frays in a lot of muslins, or drawing up

an embroidered coat. The College<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> say, this enormity
proceeds from a sort of delirium in the brain, which
makes it break out first about the head, and, for want
of timely remedies, fall upon the left thigh, and from
thence in little mazes and windings run over the whole
body, as appears by pretty ornaments on the buttons,
button-holes, garterings, sides of the breeches, and the
like. I beg the favour of you to give us a discourse
wholly upon the subject of habits, which will contribute
to the better government of conversation amongst us

"<em>The humble Petition of Ralph Nab, haberdasher of hats
and many other poor sufferers of the same trade:</em></h3>

<p>"Showeth&mdash;That for some years last past the use of
gold and silver galloon<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> upon hats has been almost universal,
being undistinguishably worn by soldiers, squires,
lords, footmen, beaus, sportsmen, traders, clerks, prigs,
smarts, cullies, pretty fellows, and sharpers.</p>

<p>"That the said use and custom has been two ways
very prejudicial to your petitioners: first, in that it has
induced men, to the great damage of your petitioners,
to wear their hats upon their heads, by which means the
said hats last much longer whole than they would do if
worn under their arms. Secondly, in that very often a
new dressing and a new lace supply the place of a new
hat, which grievance we are chiefly sensible of in the
spring-time, when the company is leaving the town; it
so happening commonly, that a hat shall frequent all
winter the finest and best assemblies without any ornaments
at all, and in May shall be tricked up with gold
or silver to keep company with rustics, and ride in the
rain.</p>

<p>"All which premises your petitioners humbly pray
you to take into your consideration, and either to
appoint a day in your Court of Honour, when all pretenders
to the galloon may enter their claims, and have
them approved or rejected, or to give us such other
relief as to your great wisdom shall seem meet.</p>

"<em>The humble Petition of Elizabeth Slender,
spinster:</em></h3>

<p>"Showeth&mdash;That on the 20th of this instant December,
her friend Rebecca Hive and your petitioner walking in
the Strand, saw a gentleman before us in a gown, whose
periwig was so long and so much powdered, that your
petitioner took notice of it, and said, she wondered that
lawyer would so spoil a new gown with powder. To
which it was answered, that he was no lawyer but a
clergyman. Upon a wager of a pot of coffee we overtook
him, and your petitioner was soon convinced she
had lost.</p>

<p>"Your petitioner therefore desires your worship to
cite the clergyman before you, and to settle and adjust
the length of canonical periwigs, and the quantity of
powder to be made use of in them, and to give such
other directions as you shall think fit.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>Q. Whether this gentleman be not chaplain to a regiment,
and in such case allow powder accordingly?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>
<p>After all that can be thought on these subjects, I must
confess, that the men who dress with a certain ambition
to appear more than they are, are much more excusable
than those who betray, in the adorning their persons, a
secret vanity and inclination to shine in things, wherein
if they did succeed, it would rather lessen than advance
their character. For this reason, I am more provoked
at the allegations relating to the clergyman, than any
other hinted at in these complaints. I have indeed a
long time with much concern observed abundance of
pretty fellows in sacred orders, and shall in due time let
them know, that I pretend to give ecclesiastical as well
as civil censures. A man well bred and well dressed
in that habit, adds to the sacredness of his function an
agreeableness not to be met with among the laity. I
own I have spent some evenings among the men of wit
of that profession with an inexpressible delight. Their
habitual care of their character gives such a chastisement
to their fancy, that all which they utter in company is as
much above what you meet with in other conversations,
as the charms of a modest are superior to those of a
light woman. I therefore earnestly desire our young
missionaries from the Universities to consider where
they are, and not dress, and look, and move like young
officers. It is no disadvantage to have a very handsome
white hand; but were I to preach repentance to a gallery
of ladies, I would, methinks, keep my gloves on. I have
an unfeigned affection to the class of mankind appointed
to serve at the altar, therefore am in danger of running
out of my way, and growing too serious on this occasion;
for which reason I shall end with the following
epistle, which, by my interest in Tom Trot the penny-post,
I procured a copy of.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The printer having informed me, that there are as
many of these papers printed as will make four
volumes, I am now come to the end of my ambition in
this matter, and have nothing further to say to the
world, under the character of Isaac Bickerstaff. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
work has indeed for some time been disagreeable to me,
and the purpose of it wholly lost by my being so long
understood as the author. I never designed in it to
give any man any secret wound by my concealment, but
spoke in the character of an old man, a philosopher, a
humourist, an astrologer, and a censor, to allure my
reader with the variety of my subjects, and insinuate, if
I could, the weight of reason with the agreeableness of
wit. The general purpose of the whole has been to
recommend truth, innocence, honour, and virtue, as the
chief ornaments of life; but I considered, that severity
of manners was absolutely necessary to him who would
censure others, and for that reason, and that only, chose
to talk in a mask. I shall not carry my humility so far
as to call myself a vicious man; but at the same time
must confess, my life is at best but pardonable. And
with no greater character than this, a man would make
but an indifferent progress in attacking prevailing and
fashionable vices, which Mr. Bickerstaff has done with
a freedom of spirit that would have lost both its beauty
and efficacy, had it been pretended to by Mr. Steele.</p>

<p>As to the work itself, the acceptance it has met with
is the best proof of its value; but I should err against
that candour which an honest man should always carry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>about him, if I did not own, that the most approved
pieces in it were written by others, and those which have
been most excepted against by myself. The hand<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> that
has assisted me in those noble discourses upon the immortality
of the soul, the glorious prospects of another
life, and the most sublime ideas of religion and virtue,
is a person who is too fondly my friend ever to own
them; but I should little deserve to be his, if I usurped
the glory of them. I must acknowledge at the same
time, that I think the finest strokes of wit and humour
in all Mr. Bickerstaff's Lucubrations are those for which
he is also beholden to him.</p>

<p>As for the satirical parts of these writings, those
against the gentlemen who profess gaming<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> are the
most licentious; but the main of them I take to come
from losing gamesters, as invectives against the fortunate;
for in very many of them, I was very little else
but the transcriber. If any have been more particularly
marked at, such persons may impute it to their own
behaviour (before they were touched upon) in publicly
speaking their resentment against the author, and professing
they would support any man who should insult
him. When I mention this subject, I hope Major-General
Davenport,<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Brigadier Bisset,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> and my Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>Forbes,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> will accept of my thanks for their frequent
good offices,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> in professing their readiness to partake
any danger that should befall me in so just an undertaking,
as the endeavour to banish fraud and cozenage
from the presence and conversation of gentlemen.</p>

<p>But what I find is the least excusable part of all this
work is, that I have, in some places in it, touched upon
matters which concern both the Church and State. All
I shall say for this is, that the points I alluded to are
such as concerned every Christian and freeholder in
England; and I could not be cold enough to conceal
my opinion on subjects which related to either of those
characters. But politics apart, I must confess, it has
been a most exquisite pleasure to me to frame characters
of domestic life, and put those parts of it which are
least observed into an agreeable view; to inquire into
the seeds of vanity and affectation, to lay before my
readers the emptiness of ambition: in a word, to trace
human life through all its mazes and recesses, and show
much shorter methods than men ordinarily practise, to
be happy, agreeable, and great.</p>

<p>But to inquire into men's faults and weaknesses has
something in it so unwelcome, that I have often seen
people in pain to act before me, whose modesty only
make them think themselves liable to censure. This,
and a thousand other nameless things, have made it an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>irksome task to me to personate Mr. Bickerstaff any
longer; and I believe it does not often happen, that the
reader is delighted where the author is displeased.</p>

<p>All I can now do for the further gratification of the
town, is to give them a faithful index and explication
of passages and allusions, and sometimes of persons intended
in the several scattered parts of the work. At
the same time, the succeeding volumes shall discover
which of the whole have been written by me, and
which by others, and by whom, as far as I am able,
or permitted.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>Thus I have voluntarily done what I think all authors
should do when called upon. I have published my name
to my writings, and given myself up to the mercy of the
town (as Shakespeare expresses it) with all my imperfections
on my head.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> The indulgent readers'</p>

and enlivens the whole man, recreates and makes cheerful
although never so sad, and in a moment raises all the sensitive faculties.
It's also to be taken inwardly by drops, which effectually takes
off and eradicates the very cause; for it potently relieves, comforts
and strengthens the brain, creates and corroborates a stomach, removes
sickness from it, helps digestion, cleanses the blood; and in a
word, is the greatest cephalic, stomatic, hepatic, and powerful aromatic
possible; therefore is extreme necessary for all Gentlemen, Ladies,
&amp;c., always to be carried in their pockets. Is only sold at Mr. King's,
Picture-shop, in the Poultry, and at Mr. Overton's, at the Golden
Buck, Picture-shop, against St. Dunstan's Church in Fleet Street, at
